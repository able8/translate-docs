# Container Runtimes Part 2: Anatomy of a Low-Level Container Runtime

*Feb 26, 2018*

This is the second in a four-part series on container runtimes. In [part 1](https://www.ianlewis.org/en/container-runtimes-part-1-introduction-container-r), I gave an overview of container runtimes and discussed the differences  between low-level and high-level runtimes. In this post I will go into  detail on low-level container runtimes.

Low-level runtimes have a limited feature set and typically perform  the low-level tasks for running a container. Most developers shouldn't  use them for their day-to-day work. Low-level runtimes are usually  implemented as simple tools or libraries that developers of higher level runtimes and tools can use for the low-level features. While most  developers won't use low-level runtimes directly, it's good to know how  they work for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

As I explained in part 1, containers are implemented using [Linux namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces) and [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups). Namespaces let you virtualize system resources, like the file system or networking for each container. On the other hand, cgroups provide a way to limit the amount of resources, such as CPU and memory, that each  container can use. At their core, low-level container runtimes are  responsible for setting up these namespaces and cgroups for containers,  and then running commands inside those namespaces and cgroups. Most  container runtimes implement more features, but those are the essential  bits.

Be sure to check out the amazing talk ["Building a container from scratch in Go"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utf-A4rODH8) by Liz Rice. Her talk is a great introduction to how low-level  container runtimes are implemented. Liz goes through many of these  steps, but the most trivial runtime you can imagine that you could still call a "container runtime" might do something like the following:
- Create cgroup
- Run command(s) in cgroup
- [Unshare](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html) to move to its own namespaces
- Clean up cgroup after command completes (namespaces are deleted automatically when not referenced by a running process)

A robust low-level container runtime, however, would do a lot more,  like allow for setting resource limits on the cgroup, setting up a root  filesystem, and chrooting the container's process to the root file  system.

# Building a Sample Runtime

Let's walk through running a simple ad hoc runtime to set up a container. We can perform the steps using the standard Linux [cgcreate](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cgcreate), [cgset](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cgset), [cgexec](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cgexec), [chroot](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html) and [unshare](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html) commands. You'll need to run most of the commands below as root.

First let's set up a root filesystem for our container. We'll use the busybox Docker container as our base. Here we create a temporary  directory and extract busybox into it. Most of these commands need to be run as root.

```
$ CID=$(docker create busybox)
$ ROOTFS=$(mktemp -d)
$ docker export $CID | tar -xf - -C $ROOTFS
```

Now let's create our cgroup and set restrictions on the memory and  CPU. Memory limits are set in bytes. Here we are setting the limit to  100MB.

```
$ UUID=$(uuidgen)
$ cgcreate -g cpu,memory:$UUID
$ cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes=100000000 $UUID
$ cgset -r cpu.shares=512 $UUID
```

CPU usage can be restricted in one of two ways. Here we set our CPU  limit using CPU "shares". Shares are an amount of CPU time relative to  other processes running at the same time. Containers running by  themselves can use the whole CPU, but if other containers are running,  they can use a proportional amount of CPU to their CPU shares.

CPU limits based on CPU cores are a bit more complicated. They let  you set hard limits on the amount of CPU cores that a container can use. Limiting CPU cores requires you set two options on the cgroup, `cfs_period_us` and `cfs_quota_us`. `cfs_period_us` specifies how often CPU usage is checked and `cfs_quota_us` specifies the amount of time that a task can run on one core in one period. Both are specified in microseconds.

For instance, if we wanted to limit our container to two cores we  could specify a period of one second and a quota of two seconds (one  second is 1,000,000 microseconds) and this would effectively allow our  process to use two cores during a one-second period. [This article](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/sec-cpu) explains this concept in depth.

```
$ cgset -r cpu.cfs_period_us=1000000 $UUID
$ cgset -r cpu.cfs_quota_us=2000000 $UUID
```

Next we can execute a command in the container. This will execute the command within the cgroup we created, unshare the specified namespaces, set the hostname, and chroot to our filesystem.

```
$ cgexec -g cpu,memory:$UUID \
>     unshare -uinpUrf --mount-proc \
>     sh -c "/bin/hostname $UUID && chroot $ROOTFS /bin/sh"
/ # echo "Hello from in a container"
Hello from in a container
/ # exit
```

Finally, after our command has completed, we can clean up by deleting the cgroup and temporary directory that we created.

```
$ cgdelete -r -g cpu,memory:$UUID
$ rm -r $ROOTFS
```

To further demonstrate how this works, I wrote a simple runtime in bash called [execc](https://github.com/ianlewis/execc). It supports mount, user, pid, ipc, uts, and network namespaces; setting memory limits; setting CPU limits by number of cores; mounting the proc file system; and running the container in its own root file system.

## Examples of Low-Level Container Runtimes

In order to better understand low-level container runtimes it's  useful to look at some examples. These runtimes implement different  features and emphasize different aspects of containerization.

### lmctfy

Though not in wide use, one container runtime of note is [lmctfy](https://github.com/google/lmctfy). lmctfy is a project by Google, based on the internal container runtime that [Borg](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html) uses. One of its most interesting features is that it supports  container hierarchies that use cgroup hierarchies via the container  names. For example, a root container called "busybox" could create  sub-containers under the name "busybox/sub1" or "busybox/sub2" where the names form a kind of path structure. As a result each sub-container can have its own cgroups that are then limited by the parent container's  cgroup. This is inspired by Borg and gives containers in lmctfy the  ability to run sub-task containers under a pre-allocated set of  resources on a server, and thus achieve more stringent SLOs than could  be provided by the runtime itself.

While lmctfy provides some interesting features and ideas, other  runtimes were more usable so Google decided it would be better for the  community to focus worked on Docker's libcontainer instead of lmctfy.

### runc

runc is currently the most widely used container runtime. It was  originally developed as part of Docker and was later extracted out as a  separate tool and library.

Internally, runc runs containers similarly to how I described it  above, but runc implements the OCI runtime spec. That means that it runs containers from a specific "OCI bundle" format. The format of the  bundle has a config.json file for some configuration and a root file  system for the container. You can find out more by reading the [OCI runtime spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) on GitHub. You can learn how to install runc from the [runc GitHub project](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc).

First create the root filesystem. Here we'll use busybox again.

```
$ mkdir rootfs
$ docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -xf - -C rootfs
```

Next create a config.json file. 

```
$ runc spec
```

This command creates a template config.json for our container. It should look something like this:

```
$ cat config.json
{
        "ociVersion": "1.0.0",
        "process": {
                "terminal": true,
                "user": {
                        "uid": 0,
                        "gid": 0
                },
                "args": [
                        "sh"
                ],
                "env": [
                        "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
                        "TERM=xterm"
                ],
                "cwd": "/",
                "capabilities": {
...
```

By default it runs the sh command in a container with a root  filesystem at ./rootfs. Since that's exactly the setup we want we can  just go ahead and run the container.

```
$ sudo runc run mycontainerid
/ # echo "Hello from in a container"
Hello from in a container
```

## rkt

rkt is a popular alternative to Docker/runc that was developed by  CoreOS. rkt is a bit hard to categorize because it provides all the  features that other low-level runtimes like runc provide, but also  provides features typical of high-level runtimes. Here I'll describe the low-level features of rkt and leave the high-level features for the  next post.

rkt originally used the [Application Container](https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/app-container.html) (appc) standard, which was developed as an open alternative standard to alternative to Docker's container format. Appc never achieved  widespread adoption as a container format and appc is no longer being  actively developed bit achieved its goals to ensure open standards are  available to the community. Instead of appc, rkt will use OCI container  formats in the future.

Application Container Image (ACI) is the image format for Appc.  Images are a tar.gz containing a manifest directory and a rootfs  directory for the root filesystem. You can read more about ACI [here](https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/spec/aci.md).

You can build a container image using the `acbuild` tool. You can use acbuild in shell scripts that can be executed much like Dockerfiles are run.

```
acbuild begin
acbuild set-name example.com/hello
acbuild dep add quay.io/coreos/alpine-sh
acbuild copy hello /bin/hello
acbuild set-exec /bin/hello
acbuild port add www tcp 5000
acbuild label add version 0.0.1
acbuild label add arch amd64
acbuild label add os linux
acbuild annotation add authors "Carly Container <carly@example.com>"
acbuild write hello-0.0.1-linux-amd64.aci
acbuild end
```

## Adiós!

I hope this helped you get an idea of what low-level container  runtimes are. While most users of containers will use higher-level  runtimes, it's good to know how containers are working underneath the  covers for troubleshooting issues and debugging.

In the next post I'll move up the stack and talk about high-level  container runtimes. I'll talk about what high-level runtimes provide and how they are much better for app developers who want to use containers. I'll also talk about popular runtimes like Docker and rkt's high-level  features.
