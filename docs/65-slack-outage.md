# Slack Outage Monday January 4, 2021

From: https://status.slack.com/2021-01/9ecc1bc75347b6d1

### Customers may have trouble connecting to or using Slack

Issue summary: 
Starting around 6:00 a.m. PST on January 4, 2021, some customers started experiencing occasional errors and increased latency while using Slack. Around 7:00 a.m. PST there was a rapid increase in errors and Slack  wasn’t usable for all customers. 

Around 8:13 a.m. PST, we addressed an issue with our provisioning  service and began provisioning healthy servers once again to address  traffic requests. From there, at 8:45 a.m. PST, some customers began to  see improvements, but others who were trying to launch their Slack  clients were unable to do so. By around 9:15 a.m. PST most customers  were able to use Slack again. We continued to experience elevated errors until 10:40 a.m. PST, after which all customers were able to use Slack  again.

 We also discovered some customers were stuck on a webpage in the Slack  desktop app. This is a separate bug that’s being investigated, but was  heightened during the outage. Troubleshooting steps, such as restarting, forcing quitting Slack from Activity Monitor or Task Manager, or  clearing cache, allowed affected customers to access the app once again.

 We know our customers rely on Slack. Our top priorities are working  alongside our cloud vendors to fully understand the underlying causes of the outage and putting safeguards in place to prevent similar problems  from happening again. If you’d like to receive a full Root Cause  Analysis (RCA) report, please reach out to feedback@slack.com to request one.

For any customers unable to access Slack, please try refreshing by using  CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + R. It may also help to try closing Slack via the Task Manager or Activity Monitor. If you encounter any trouble, please let  us know at feedback@slack.com. 

 We'll have a separate post on this site for the outstanding calendar apps and email notifications trouble. 

 We're truly sorry for the disruption today. We'll be back with a summary of this issue.

 Note: We've edited this message to ask users to refresh their clients  entirely, as opposed to the reload instructions we shared before  (CMD/CTRL + R). It's also been edited to ask users to try force closing  their app.

Jan 5, 4:10 AM GMT+8

We're seeing improvements with error rates on our side, and we believe affected customers should be able to access Slack. 

 We're continuing to work to resolve the trouble with calendar apps and email notifications.

Jan 5, 3:28 AM GMT+8

For those customers who are unable to access Slack (e.g. seeing a blank  screen or error), please try reloading (CTRL/CMD + R). If you can access Slack, please hold off on reloading at this time. 

 In addition, Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar aren't working as  expected, and some email notifications (e.g. a notification of a new  direct message in Slack) are failing to send.

 Note: We've updated this message to specify holding off on reloading if you can access Slack.

Some customers may be able to connect, but may also experience degraded  performance. We're continuing to work to resolve the issue.

Jan 5, 2:00 AM GMT+8

While the issue is largely still ongoing, we believe some customers may see  improvement in connecting to Slack after a refresh (CTRL/CMD + R).

Jan 5, 1:29 AM GMT+8

There are no changes to report as of yet. We're still all hands on deck and  continuing to dig in on our side. We'll continue to share updates every  30 minutes until the incident has been downgraded.

Jan 5, 12:52 AM GMT+8

We're continuing to investigate connection issues for customers, and have  upgraded the incident on our side to reflect an outage in service. All  hands are on deck on our end to further investigate. We'll be back in a  half hour to keep you posted.

Jan 5, 12:20 AM GMT+8

We’re still investigating the ongoing connectivity issues with Slack. There's no additional information to share just yet, but we’ll follow up in 30  minutes. Thanks for bearing with us.

Jan 4, 11:44 PM GMT+8

Customers may have trouble loading channels or connecting to Slack at this time.  Our team is investigating and we'll follow up with more information as  soon as we have it. We apologize for any disruption caused.
