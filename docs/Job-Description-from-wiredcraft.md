- **Design technical solutions**. Collaborating with  client teams and and project managers, you’ll help clarify requirements, pick the right technologies and plan the technical solutions. This  usually includes designing data models, API specifications and sequence  diagrams.
- **Lead the development**. You will own the technical  implementation. This means you’ll spend time implementing core parts of  the system, mentoring/reviewing more junior team members, helping to  bring QA, Devops and product management together and making sure the  system is tight (both in terms of features and security).
- **Collaborate with our clients**. Most of our  projects involve a fair amount of communication and strategizing with  the product and tech teams of our clients to clarify strategies and  design solutions. You will be the technical expert to represent  Wiredcraft.

## We are looking for someone who:

- **Has 4+ years professional experience in software development**. You should have solid technical chops and a track record of leading and contributing to software development projects.
