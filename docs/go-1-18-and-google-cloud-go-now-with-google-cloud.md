On March 15th, the Go team [announced](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18) Go 1.18 GA, the latest release of the Go programming language. The culmination of over a decade of design delivers the features our developers demanded: generics, fuzzing, and module workspaces. With this release, Go becomes the first major language to integrate fuzz testing into its core toolchain without using third-party support, further establishing Go as a preferred language for developing secure applications.

Go was created at Google in 2007, designed to help developers build fast, reliable, and secure software. Unlike traditional languages, Go was built for the modern multi-core computing world. Go has emerged as a modern language for developing cloud applications, services, and infrastructure. Today Go powers several of Google’s largest products, and is used by many customers to scale their businesses. Organizations big and small love Go and the community of Go developers, known as “gophers” has grown into a global network with over 2 million users worldwide.

### Using the power of Go in the Cloud

When looking at the public repos, over 75% of [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) projects including Kubernetes are written in Go and [10% of developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language) are writing in Go worldwide (as of May 2021). Google delivers high performance infrastructure to run key, cloud native, Open Source projects. Our modern cloud infrastructure is based on Kubernetes at its core and our strong support for Istio and Knative have formed the base of some of our leading services like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), our managed application platform with Anthos, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run. Google uses Go extensively for a wide range of applications from our [indexing platform that powers Google Search](https://go.dev/solutions/google/coredata), to the [server side optimizations that power Chrome’s 1B+ users](https://go.dev/solutions/google/chrome), to the [infrastructure on which Google cloud is built](https://go.dev/solutions/google/sitereliability).

### Release Highlights

With this new release of Go 1.18, Generics are the biggest change to Go since the language was created. Go developers told us that they feel that Go lacks critical features, with generics being the main missing piece. With Go 1.18, new and existing Go developers can take advantage of the productivity, performance, and maintenance benefits that generics can bring. We’ve already begun to see the new kinds of libraries and projects gophers are building with generics in its short beta period, and expect this creativity to grow as time goes on.

This Go release also brings native support for fuzzing. Fuzzing is a type of vulnerability testing that throws arbitrary data at a piece of software to expose unknown errors and is emerging as a common testing scheme in enterprise development. Go is now the first major language to provide fuzzing support with no third-party integrations necessary, allowing developers to start building secure software with minimal additional cost. Go’s innovative approach to fuzzing can provide not only security for the current code but also ongoing protection as code and dependencies evolve.  With attacks on software becoming more common and complex, vulnerability detection can be a critical part of the enterprise development lifecycle, and Go’s fuzzing capabilities catch vulnerabilities earlier in the lifecycle.

### Build securely using Go

At Google we are helping to make Open Source software secure. Open source software is a connective tissue for much of the online world. At Google, we’ve been working to [raise awareness](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/know-prevent-fix-framework-for-shifting.html) of the state of open source security and are committed to helping secure the software supply chain for organizations. Go has been designed to create secure applications, helping to minimize risk as much as possible. Go applications compile down to a single binary without local dependencies. It’s not uncommon to see an application built using only the standard library, or only a couple well-vetted Go dependencies. Go’s dependency management uses tamper-evident [transparency log](https://transparency.dev), with built in tooling that helps ensure your dependencies are what you can expect. Go has native encryption, which is used across much of the internet, including key components of Google. Go even supports distroless containers, where there are zero local dependencies to worry about. Google Cloud products like [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build), for CI/CDand [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry), for container management, and have direct access to Go’s vulnerability database and can provide you instant warnings about security threats.

_**“At Google we are committed to helping to secure the online infrastructure and applications upon which the world depends. A critical aspect of this mission is being able to understand and verify the security of open source dependency chains. The 1.18 release of Go is an important step towards helping to ensure that developers are able to build secure applications, understand risk when vulnerabilities are discovered, and reduce the impact of cybersecurity attacks”** said Eric Brewer, VP Infrastructure, Google Fellow_

This launch is a significant milestone for Go that helps developers from around the world build more performant and secure applications that run on any infrastructure.
