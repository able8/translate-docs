# Package management in Go

## Brief overview of package management in Go — pre and post Go modules

By Jai on August 26, 2019

Package management is one of the things Go has always missed. One of the major drawbacks of the previous (pre 1.11) `go get` was lack of support for managing dependency versions and enabling  reproducible builds. The community has developed package managers and  tools like Glide, dep and [many others](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PackageManagementTools) serving as de-facto solutions for versioning dependencies.

> “I use go get for production builds.” — said no one ever.

Go’s implementation of package management traces its origins back to Google  (which has a giant monolithic repository for all their source code).  Let’s break down on what’s wrong with ‘pre - go module’ package  management tooling.

1. Versioning dependencies
2. Vendoring dependencies
3. The necessity of `GOPATH`

## Versioning dependencies

`go get` by default didn’t support module versioning. The idea behind the first  version of go’s package management was — no need for module versioning,  no need for 3rd-party module repositories, you build everything from  your current branch.

Pre Go 1.11, adding a dependency meant cloning that dependency’s source code repo in your `GOPATH`. That was about it. There was no concept of versions. Rather, it always  pointed to the current master branch at the time of cloning. Another  major issue cropped up when different projects needed different versions of a dependency — which wasn’t possible either.

## Vendoring dependencies

Package vendoring is commonly referred to as the case where dependent packages  are stored in the same place as your project. That usually means your  dependencies are checked into your source management system, such as  Git.

Consider this case — A uses dependency B, which uses a  feature of dependency C introduced in version 1.5 of C, B must be able  to ensure that A’s build uses C 1.5 or later. Pre Go 1.5, there was no  mechanism for carrying dependency code alongside commands without  rewriting import paths.

## Necessity of `GOPATH`

`GOPATH` exists for two main reasons:

1. In Go, the `import` declaration references a package via its fully qualified import path. `GOPATH` exist so that from any directory inside `GOPATH/src` the go tool can compute the absolute import path of the package in question.
2. A location to store dependencies fetched by `go get.`

What’s wrong with this?

1. `GOPATH` doesn’t allow checking out the source of a project in a directory of choice like they are used to with other languages.
2. Additionally, `GOPATH` does not let the developer have more than one copy of a project (or its dependencies) checked out at the same time.

## Introducing Go Modules

Go 1.11 introduces preliminary support for Go modules. From Go Wiki,

> A *module* is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together as a single unit. Modules record precise dependency requirements and create  reproducible builds.

Go modules brings three important features built-in,

1. `go.mod` file similar to `package.json` or `Pipfile`.
2. A machine-generated transitive dependency description - `go.sum`.
3. No more `GOPATH` limitation. Modules can be in any path.

```bash
$ go help mod
Go mod provides access to operations on modules.

Note that support for modules is built into all the go commands,
not just 'go mod'. For example, day-to-day adding, removing, upgrading,
and downgrading of dependencies should be done using 'go get'.
See 'go help modules' for an overview of module functionality.

Usage:

	go mod <command> [arguments]

The commands are:

	download    download modules to local cache
	edit        edit go.mod from tools or scripts
	graph       print module requirement graph
	init        initialize new module in current directory
	tidy        add missing and remove unused modules
	vendor      make vendored copy of dependencies
	verify      verify dependencies have expected content
	why         explain why packages or modules are needed

Use "go help mod <command>" for more information about a command.
```

## Migrating to Go Modules

To use Go modules, update Go to version `>= 1.11`. Since `GOPATH` is going away, one can activate module support in one of these two ways:

- Invoke the `go` command in a directory outside of the `GOPATH/src` tree, with a valid `go.mod` file in the current directory.
- Go modules don’t work if source is under `GOPATH`. To override this behaviour, invoke the `go` command with `GO111MODULE=on` environment variable set.

Let’s start porting by following these simple steps:

- As `GOPATH` isn’t necessary anymore, move the module out of `GOPATH`.
- From the project root, create the initial module definition - `go mod init github.com/username/repository`. The best part is, `go mod` automatically converts dependencies from existing package managers like `dep`, `Gopkg`, `glide` and [six others](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/cmd/go/internal/modconv/?m=all#pkg-variables). This will create a file called `go.mod` with the module name and dependencies with its versions.

```bash
$ cat go.mod
module github.com/deepsourcelabs/cli

go 1.12

require (
	github.com/certifi/gocertifi v0.0.0-20190410005359-59a85de7f35e
	github.com/getsentry/raven-go v0.2.0
	github.com/pkg/errors v0.0.0-20190227000051-27936f6d90f9
```

- Run `go build` to create a `go.sum` file which contains the expected cryptographic checksums of the content of specific module versions. This is to ensure that future downloads of these modules retrieve the same bits as the first download. Note that  go.sum is not a lock file.

```bash
$ cat go.sum
github.com/certifi/gocertifi v0.0.0-20190410005359-59a85de7f35e h1:9574pc8MX6rF/QyO14SPHhM5KKIOo9fkb/1ifuYMTKU=

```

> Note on versioning: To maintain backward compatibility, if the module is version v2 or higher, the major version of the module *must* be included as a `/vN` at the end of the module paths used in `go.mod `files (e.g., `module github.com/username/repository/v2`

## Everyday commands

### List dependencies

`go list -m all` lists the current module and all its dependencies.

```bash
$ go list -m all
github.com/deepsourcelabs/cli
github.com/certifi/gocertifi v0.0.0-20190410005359-59a85de7f35e
github.com/getsentry/raven-go v0.2.0
github.com/pkg/errors v0.0.0-20190227000051-27936f6d90f9
```

> In the `go list` output, the current module, also known as the *main module*, is always the first line, followed by dependencies sorted by module path.

### List available versions of a package

`go list -m -versions github.com/username/repository` lists available versions of a package.

```bash
$ go list -m -versions github.com/getsentry/raven-go
github.com/getsentry/raven-go v0.1.0 v0.1.1 v0.1.2 v0.2.0
```

### Add a dependency

Adding a dependency is implicit. After importing a dependency in code, running `go build` or `go test` command gets the latest version of the module and adds it to `go.mod` file. If you would like to add a dependency explicitly, run`go get github.com/username/repository`.

### Upgrade/downgrade a dependency

`go get github.com/username/repository@vx.x.x` downloads and sets the specific version of the dependency and updates `go.mod` file.

```bash
$ go get github.com/getsentry/raven-go@v0.1.2
go: finding github.com/getsentry/raven-go v0.1.2
go: downloading github.com/getsentry/raven-go v0.1.2
go: extracting github.com/getsentry/raven-go v0.1.2
$ cat go.mod
module github.com/deepsourcelabs/marvin-go

go 1.12

```

### Vendoring dependencies

When using modules, the go command completely ignores vendor directories.  For backward compatibility with older versions of Go, or to ensure that  all files used for a build are stored together in a single file tree,  run`go mod vendor`.

This creates a directory named `vendor` in the root directory of the main module and stores all the packages from dependency modules there.

> Note: To build using the main module’s top-level vendor directory, run ‘go build -mod=vendor’.

### Remove unused dependencies

`go mod tidy` trims unused dependencies and updates `go.mod` file.

## FAQs

#### Is `GOPATH` not needed anymore?

No. Farewell `GOPATH`.

#### Which version is pulled by default?

The go.mod file and the go command more generally use semantic versions as  the standard form for describing module versions, so that versions can  be compared to determine which should be considered earlier or later  than another. A module version like `v1.2.3` is introduced by tagging a revision in the underlying source repository. Untagged  revisions can be referred to using a “pseudo-version” like `v0.0.0-yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef`, where the time is the commit time in UTC and the final suffix is the prefix of the commit hash.

#### Should `go.sum` be checked into version control?

Yes.
