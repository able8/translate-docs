## What is a shim?

[A container runtime shim](http://iximiuz.com/en/posts/journey-from-containerization-to-orchestration-and-beyond/#runtime-shims) is a piece of software that resides in between [a container manager ( _containerd_, _cri-o_, _podman_)](http://iximiuz.com/en/posts/journey-from-containerization-to-orchestration-and-beyond/#container-management) and [a container runtime ( _runc_, _crun_)](http://iximiuz.com/en/posts/journey-from-containerization-to-orchestration-and-beyond/#container-runtimes) solving the integration problem of these counterparts.

_Layered Docker architecture_

The easiest way to spot a shim is to inspect the process tree on a Linux host with a running docker container:

![Spotting container runtime shim process](http://iximiuz.com/implementing-container-runtime-shim/ps-shim-example.png)

_`ps auxf` output on a host running `docker run -it ubuntu bash`; notice `containerd-shim` process in between `containerd` and `bash`._

On the one hand, runtimes need shims to be able to survive managers restarts. On the other hand, shims are helping container managers to deal with the quirky behavior of runtimes. As a part of [the container manager implementation series](http://iximiuz.com/en/posts/conman-the-container-manager-inception/), we will try to create our own shim and then integrate it with [_conman_](https://github.com/iximiuz/conman), an experimental container manager. Hopefully, during the development, we will gain an in-depth understanding of the topic.

However, before jumping to the shim development, we need to familiarize ourselves with the container runtime component of the choice. Unsurprisingly, _conman_ uses _runc_ as a container runtime, so I will start the article by covering basic _runc_ use cases alongside its design quirks. Then I'll show the naive way to use _runc_ from code and explain some related pitfalls. The final part of the article will provide an overview of the shim's design.

## Playing with runc

The detailed explanation of _what is a container runtime_ and _why do we need one_ is out of the scope of this article. If you are lacking this knowledge, read [this section first](http://iximiuz.com/en/posts/journey-from-containerization-to-orchestration-and-beyond/#container-runtimes), then check out [_runc_](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) README file, and try out `runc --help`.

Long story short, _runc_ is **a command-line tool** for running containerized applications. If this sentence sounds too fancy, you can think of _runc_ as just a tool to spawn a new ordinary Linux process but inside of an isolated environment. The isolation among other things includes a dedicated root file system and a new process tree and is being achieved via Linux _namespaces_ and _cgroups_ facilities. Let's call this new process that _runc_ launches **a container process**. This process becomes the first process (i.e. _PID=1_) inside of the newly started container. We will be referring to this process frequently throughout the rest of the article.

Even though _runc_ is most often used behind _Docker_ (through _containerd_) or _cri-o_ daemons while both oftentimes reside behind a _kubelet_, it's a standalone executable file, i.e. _runc_ is by no means a library. We will see further on how this design makes the usage of _runc_ from another software somewhat complicated, but now let's try to just play with this tool in our favorite terminal emulator:

_**NB:** runc supports running containers controlled by a [Linux pseudoterminal](http://iximiuz.com/en/posts/linux-pty-what-powers-docker-attach-functionality/), but today we will not use this functionality and leave its consideration to a separate article._

```bash
# Prepare some directories.
$ mkdir -p container1/rootfs
$ cd container1

# Use docker to create a root
# filesystem for our new container.
$ sudo bash -c 'docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -'

# Create a default bundle (i.e. container) config.
$ runc spec

# Change the default command (sh) to
# sh -c 'echo Hi, my PID is $$; sleep 10; echo Bye Bye'
$ sed -i 's/"sh"/"sh", "-c", "echo Hi, my PID is $$; sleep 10; echo Bye Bye"/' config.json

# Do not use pseudoterminal (PTY) to control the container process.
# PTY use cases lie out of the scope of this article.
$ sed -i 's/"terminal": true/"terminal": false/' config.json

# Review the bundle config (optional).
$ less config.json

# Run the container with ID cont1.
$ sudo runc run cont1

```

If we check the corresponding process tree using `ps axfo pid,ppid,command` in the separate terminal session we will see something similar to this:

![Process tree with running container](http://iximiuz.com/implementing-container-runtime-shim/runc-foreground-ps-tree.png)

The process hierarchy seems absolutely normal. Our login _bash_ session ( _PID 9503_) [fork-execed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93exec) _runc_ process which in turn forked itself (probably due to [PID namespace implementation related reasons](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html)) and the second fork finally launched the _sh_ shell ( _PID 22437_) inside of the containerized environment.

Now, let's take a look at the produced output:

```
Hi, my PID is 1
Bye Bye

```

Notice, that even though from the host system we see the PID of the _sh_ process as _22437_, our tiny script printed out `Hi, my PID is 1`. That's perfect proof that it got its own process ID namespace. We also should set our eyes on the fact that the _stdout_ content of the container was just printed out to our terminal, meaning that _stdio streams_ of our login bash shell have been [passed through](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/201b06374548b64212f4ceb1529688d435e42899/docs/terminals.md#-pass-through) to the container and then set as its own _stdio streams_. **Thatâ€™s an important observation we need to keep in mind.** We can try to represent the process structure as follows:

![runc reparenting container process](http://iximiuz.com/implementing-container-runtime-shim/runc-foreground-stdio.png)

The approach to run containers we just explored is called [**foreground**](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/201b06374548b64212f4ceb1529688d435e42899/docs/terminals.md#foreground) in _runc_ terminology. It means that the _runc_ process always stays in between the container process and the launching process (bash shell in our example). There is another mode supported by _runc_, called [**detached**](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/201b06374548b64212f4ceb1529688d435e42899/docs/terminals.md#detached). Let's try to use it:

```bash
# from the container1 folder
sudo runc run --detach cont1-detached

```

Notice, how _runc_ releases the execution back to our login shell almost instantly. If we check the corresponding process tree, we will see the following picture:

![runc in detached mode](http://iximiuz.com/implementing-container-runtime-shim/runc-detached-ps-tree.png)

Seems like _runc_ exited completely after it has spawned the container process. And the container process has been reparented to the host's _PID 1_ process. There is no connection between the launching process (our login shell) and the container process... except for the passed-through _stdio streams_! The output of the container process once again has been printed out to our terminal, but this time the lines produced by the container are interleaved with the login shell prompt appearance:

```
$ sudo runc run --detach cont1-detached
Hi, my PID is 1
$ Bye Bye

```

We can try to depict the corresponding structure of the involved processes and their _stdio streams_ as follows:

![container and container runtime - process tree](http://iximiuz.com/implementing-container-runtime-shim/runc-detached-stdio.png)

That's how the detached mode is described by _runc_ [documentation](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/201b06374548b64212f4ceb1529688d435e42899/docs/terminals.md#detached):

> In contrast to foreground mode, in detached mode there is no long-running foreground runc process once the container has started. In fact, there is no long-running `runc` process at all. However, this means that it is up to the caller to handle the stdio after `runc` has set it up for you. In a shell this means that the `runc` command will exit and control will return to the shell, after the container has been set up.

> You can run `runc` in detached mode in one of the following ways:

> - `runc run -d` ... which operates similar to `runc run` but is detached.
> - `runc create` followed by `runc start` which is the standard container lifecycle defined by the OCI runtime specification ( `runc create` sets up the container completely, waiting for `runc start` to begin execution of user code).

> The main use-case of detached mode is for higher-level tools that want to be wrappers around `runc`. By running `runc` in detached mode, those tools have far more control over the container's `stdio` without `runc` getting in the way (most wrappers around `runc` like `cri-o` or `containerd` use detached mode for this reason).

> Unfortunately using detached mode is a bit more complicated and requires more care than the foreground mode -- mainly because it is now up to the caller to handle the `stdio` of the container.

We need to admit, that the foreground mode has some significant drawbacks and the detached mode has been designed in a way to eliminate them. From [the same document](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/201b06374548b64212f4ceb1529688d435e42899/docs/terminals.md#foreground):

> The main drawback of the foreground mode of operation is that it requires a long-running foreground runc process. If you kill the foreground runc process then you will no longer have access to the stdio of the container (and in most cases this will result in the container dying abnormally due to SIGPIPE or some other error). By extension this means that any bug in the long-running foreground runc process (such as a memory leak) or a stray OOM-kill sweep could result in your container being killed through no fault of the user. In addition, there is no way in foreground mode of passing a file descriptor directly to the container process as its stdio (like --preserve-fds does).

## A naive attempt to use runc from code

By this time we already know how quirky _runc_ is when it comes to handling its _stdio_ streams. We also know the desired mode to use if we want to run _runc_ from container management software. Let's try to make a naive program launching a container with the following _sh_ program:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

function report_sigpipe() {
    echo "got SIGPIPE, exiting..." > /var/trap.log;
    exit 1;
}

trap report_sigpipe SIGPIPE;

while sleep 1
do
    echo "time is $(date)";
done

```

The idea of the script is fairly simple. Every second it writes the current time to its _stdout_. Additionally, it catches the _SIGPIPE_ signal (using [`trap`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trap.1p.html)) and reports it by writing `/var/trap.log` file, then exits.

Now, let's prepare a _runc_ bundle:

```bash
$ mkdir -p container2/rootfs
$ cd container2

$ sudo bash -c 'docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -'

$ cat > rootfs/entrypoint.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/sh

function report_sigpipe() {
    echo "got SIGPIPE, exiting..." > /var/trap.log;
    exit 1;
}

trap report_sigpipe SIGPIPE;

while sleep 1
do
    echo "time is $(date)";
done
EOF

$ runc spec

$ sed -i 's/"sh"/"sh", "entrypoint.sh"/' config.json
$ sed -i 's/"terminal": true/"terminal": false/' config.json

# Make the rootfs writable to be able to save /var/trap.log.
$ sed -i 's/"readonly": true/"readonly": false/' config.json

```

Finally, let's quickly make a tiny _Go_ container management program. As any container manager, it should be interested in the container's _stdout_ content. It will be reading the data written by the container to its _stdout_ and reporting it back to us. And as we learned earlier, we need to use _runc_ in the detached mode:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "os/exec"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    // We want to have a full control on the container's
    // stdout, so we are creating a pipe to redirect it.
    rd, wr, err := os.Pipe()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer rd.Close()
    defer wr.Close()

    // Start runc in detached mode.
    fmt.Println("Launching runc")

    cmd := exec.Command("runc", "run", "--detach", os.Args[1])
    cmd.Stdin = nil  // i.e. /dev/null
    cmd.Stderr = nil // i.e. /dev/null
    cmd.Stdout = wr
    if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Read some data from the container's stdout.
    buf := make([]byte, 1024)
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        n, err := rd.Read(buf)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
        output := strings.TrimSuffix(string(buf[:n]), "\n")
        fmt.Printf("Container produced: [%s]\n", output)

    }

    // Get bored quickly, give up and exit.
    fmt.Println("We are done, exiting...")
}

```

Now let's try to use our manager to run a container with the aforementioned script:

```bash
$ sudo `which go` run main.go cont2
Launching runc
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
Container produced: [time is Sun Dec 15 16:34:25 UTC 2019]
We are done, exiting...

```

It seems like a successful attempt. However, if we check the status of the container after the manager's exit we will notice that the container has been stopped as well:

```bash
$ sudo runc state cont2
{
"ociVersion": "1.0.1-dev",
"id": "cont2",
"pid": 0,
"status": "stopped",
"bundle": "/home/vagrant/container2",
"rootfs": "/home/vagrant/container2/rootfs",
"created": "2019-12-15T17:03:24.266072187Z",
"owner": ""
}

```

This is obviously not the desired behavior. Even though the container manager exited, we want to have the container running indefinitely. We even used the detached mode, so we know that the container process was reparented to the host's _init_ process right after the `runc run --detach` execution. So, what happened to the container?

It's not hard to guess, that the actual container termination reason should have something to do with the ability to write to its _stdout_. If we check the `/var/trap.log` file we will prove that theory quickly:

```bash
$ cat rootfs/var/trap.log
got SIGPIPE, exiting...

```

**This exercise shows that if we want to keep control of the container's _stdio_ streams, the container process cannot be independent of the launching process.** And since we know, that the container manager can be restarted due to a crash, update, or some other reasons, that makes it impossible to launch _runc_ directly from the container manager process. Thus, we need to have a helper process living as long as the underlying container process and serving it. And such a process called **container runtime shim**.

## The full scope of the shim

A container runtime shim is a lightweight daemon launching _runc_ and controlling the container process. The shim's process is tightly bound to the container's process but is completely detached from the manager's process. All the communications between the container and the manager happen through the shim. Examples of the production-ready shims out there is [conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) and containerd [_runtime shim_](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/runtime/v2/shim.go). The shim usually is responsible for the following (and probably some other) things:

- Serves container's _stdout_ and _stderr_ streams even during the manager restart. This allows container managers to have containers _stdout_ and _stderr_ forwarded to log files at any given moment. This is the feature powering `docker logs <container>` and `kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>` commands. When a container manager is being requested to provide some container logs, it just can read them directly from the predefined location on disk. For instance, `kubectl logs` triggers the following delegation chain `kubectl <-- network --> Kubernetes Core API <-- network --> kubelet <-- (CRI gRPC API) --> CRI Runtime Service (cri-o, containerd, docker) <-- read() --> logs on node's disk`.

- Attaches to a running container. Container managers usually provide ways to stream some data in and out from the container, including PTY-controlled scenarios. For that, the shim needs to keep the _stdin_ of the container also open. The shim can establish a socket server accepting connections and performing the streaming to and from the container's _stdio_ to the attached clients. This powers `kubectl run -i`, `podman run -i --tty`, as well as the famous PTY-controlled interactive Docker use case (eg. `docker run -it ubuntu:latest bash`).

- Keeps track of container exit code. In the detached mode, _runc_ deliberately daemonizes the container process by forking and then exiting the foreground process. The container process then gets reparented, by default to the host's _init_ process. Having containers detached leads to an absence of container status update. One way to address this problem is to make the shim process a [_subreaper_](http://iximiuz.com/en/posts/dealing-with-processes-termination-in-Linux/#awaiting-a-grandchild-process-termination). This way the container process will be reparented to the shim process. Then the shim can wait for the container's process termination and report its exit code to a predefined destination (eg. a file on the disk). The corresponding container manager can pick it up later.

- Synchronizes container manager with the container creation status. Since _runc_ daemonizes the container creation process we need a side-channel (eg. a Unix socket) to communicate the actual start (or failure) of the container back to the container manager. `runc` reports the container creation error via its _stderr_. Since exactly the same file descriptor, later on, can become the container process' _stderr_ the shim needs to carefully consume all the data in it until the runtime process termination occurs and report it to the container manager immediately. Thus, if we make a typo in our container command, the actual error will be reported back to us during the container creation phase: `docker run -it ubuntu bahs docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:345: starting container process caused "exec: \"bahs\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown.`


## Shim implementation overview

We already know that the container runtime shim has to be a long-lived daemon tightly bound to the container process. Its structure can be expressed as the following diagram:

![Container runtime shim lifecycle](http://iximiuz.com/implementing-container-runtime-shim/shim-implementation.png)

The main process of the shim is short-lived and serves the purpose of the daemonization of the shim. It forks the actual shim daemon process, writes its PID on disk and exits immediately, leaving the shim detached from the launching process (i.e. a container manager). The long-lived shim daemon process starts from creating a new session and detaching its _stdio_ streams from the parent (by redirecting them to `/dev/null`). This is somewhat common steps for any daemon-alike software. Then it forks one more process, the predecessor of the container process. This process `exec` s `runc create` with the provided parameters (bundle dir, config.json, etc). The shim daemon process waits for the termination of the container predecessor and then reports the status of this operation back to the container manager. At this point, we have only a single shim daemon process and a detached container process. However, shim process is a subreaper of the container process. At last, the shim daemon process can start serving the container's _stdio_ streams as well as awaiting the container termination. Once the container termination status is known, the shim process writes it to a predefined location on disk and exits.
