# OKRs v KPIs - How they work together

TL;DR - There is a natural overlap between key results and key performance  indicators. A metric can move in either direction depending on the focus of the business and the state of the metric.

KPIs and KRs (the  Key Results of OKR) are powerful tools, but I’ve seen an increasing  amount of bad advice on the subject. In a desire to make the definitions of KPIs and KRs clean, many observers state that a single metric is  either a KR or a KPI, but it can’t be both.

As a definition it  keeps things simple, but the distinction is artificial and inhibiting.   The main difference between a KR and a KPI is timing and context. Let’s pick this apart with a question.


### What job is your metric doing?

I believe there are two main jobs that a metric does in this context.

1. Represent the current measurable outcome we are working towards. 
2. Provide a measure of something that is important to the business, but is not the current focus of your work.

OKR is concerned with number 1 and key results are the metrics  you are currently focused on impacting. This is your most important  work. Ideally you are reviewing these on a weekly basis. 

KPIs are concerned with number 2. [Felipe Castro](https://felipecastro.com/en/blog/okr-vs-kpis/) calls them Health Metrics, because they tell you if everything is okay with the business. 

### The overlap

My argument is that a particular metric can be used for 1 or 2, depending on the focus.

Let’s work through a simplified example. 

This is applied to a B2B SaaS I’ve worked with, but could apply to many different products. 

This is a mature product and customers are loyal. Churn is less than 5% and  we’re happy as long as it remains under 7.5%. We’ve looked at the data  behind churn and decided there are too many different factors to make  reducing it further cost effective right now.

Naturally we keep an eye on it, every month we look at the churn data and it’s on senior leaders’ radar. It really is a **Key** performance Indicator.

Our current focus is getting more website visitors to start a trial of our product and our OKRs reflect that priority.

A few month’s later we’ve made good progress on acquisition but churn has ticked upwards. It’s now 11% and it is seriously jeopardising our  bottom line.

### Time to focus on that KPI

Leaders are concerned and want to focus on this problem. At the next OKR  setting a cross-functional team is charged with reducing churn.  The logical decision is to make this KPI a key result. 

That team  includes a product person, an engineering lead and a service desk  person.  Unless the team stumbles upon an obvious cause and finds a very quick solution, they will treat churn as their key result for a period  of time. Identifying and testing hypotheses as they go. As a strong team they are considering several opportunities and solutions at once. 

After some great product discovery work the team makes some changes and churn is reduced. Please note, in the real world, churn is usually a lagging  measure. To counter this the team may identify one or more leading  metrics. 

### Carry on tracking, but focus elsewhere

With the problem solved sufficiently well, the team can focus on a new  problem. Churn goes back to being a KPI and the leading metrics the team identify is added to the set.

The point I am making with this example is that KRs and KPIs are tools. They either help you:

- keep a track on things that are important but not a strategic priority, or
- track progress  towards current strategic outcomes.

In either case they’re an important measure of business success. In a future post I will go deeper into this example to explore the  connection between leading and lagging measures. It will also help us  understand how organisation and team key results can connect.

### An engineering focused example:

Load time for our search page is a KPI. We’ve got a sound  architecture and this metric has been within threshold for many  quarters.  We then see  load time has crept up and our own research  tells us that this is a leading indicator for reduced usage. We make  reducing page load time a priority for the next quarter and a KR is  created.

A cross-functional team quickly identifies a few contributing factors and tests and builds the required solutions. They soon have the page  load time back where it needs to be and the metric is back as a KPI  only.

Hopefully these couple of examples help explain why there can be  overlap between KPIs and KRs. Quite simply we should only be looking at  metrics that are important. If something we track (a KPI) is critically  unaligned, then we should focus on it (a KR). No need for dogma.
