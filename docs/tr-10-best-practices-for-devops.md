DevOps is helping organizations keep pace with the skyrocketing demand for mobile app development. Here are 10 best practices for managing successful DevOps projects.

DevOps 正在帮助组织跟上对移动应用程序开发的飞速发展的需求。以下是管理成功 DevOps 项目的 10 个最佳实践。

DevOps ... in less than two minutes

DevOps ... 不到两分钟

In June 2015, Gartner forecasted that, "By the end of 2017, [market demand for mobile app development services](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3076817) will grow at least five times faster than internal IT organizations' capacity to deliver them." In fact, across the board, enterprises are already seeing their application workloads soar. As a result, more organization are adopting DevOps--a methodology that can speed app development and delivery by getting application developers and operations specialists to collaborate throughout the end-to-end app development and deployment process. Here are 10 DevOps best practices that are gaining traction in organizations.

2015 年 6 月，Gartner 预测，“到 2017 年底，[移动应用开发服务的市场需求](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3076817) 的增长速度将至少比内部快五倍IT 组织交付它们的能力。”事实上，企业已经看到他们的应用程序工作负载猛增。因此，越来越多的组织正在采用 DevOps——一种可以通过让应用程序开发人员和运营专家在整个端到端应用程序开发和部署过程中进行协作来加快应用程序开发和交付的方法。以下是 10 个在组织中越来越受欢迎的 DevOps 最佳实践。

## 1: Break the silos in IT

## 1：打破 IT 中的孤岛

Breaking down functional silos between disciplines in IT must come from upper management, since IT has been organized into disciplinary silos for decades. In this environment, application development work has historically taken an assembly line approach, with one department building the app, after which the app is shipped to an operations group to integrate the app, after which the app is tested by a QA group, after which the app goes back to the applications and operations group so it can be deployed.

打破 IT 学科之间的功能孤岛必须来自高层管理人员，因为 IT 几十年来一直被组织成学科孤岛。在这种环境下，应用程序开发工作历来采用流水线方式，一个部门构建应用程序，然后将应用程序运送到运营组以集成应用程序，然后由质量保证组测试应用程序，然后该应用程序返回到应用程序和操作组，以便进行部署。

This separation of functions limits active collaboration, contributing to applications problems that delay deployment. Pressured to deliver today's apps faster, IT managers have begun to restructure IT into DevOps teams that are a mix of all of the IT disciplines, with each team getting accountability for a specific category of apps.

这种功能分离限制了主动协作，从而导致延迟部署的应用程序问题。迫于加快交付当今应用程序的压力，IT 经理已开始将 IT 重组为 DevOps 团队，这些团队由所有 IT 学科组成，每个团队都对特定类别的应用程序负责。

## 2: Adjust performance reviews

## 2：调整绩效评估

When the IT culture needs to be "de-siloized," putting some teeth into the process by evaluating team performance and individual participation on the team in performance reviews can go a long way. Base a larger portion of performance reviews for developers and operations personnel on their teams' ability to meeting app development and deployment goals.

当 IT 文化需要“去孤岛化”时，通过评估团队绩效和团队中的个人参与绩效评估，在流程中投入一些精力可以大有帮助。开发人员和运营人员的大部分绩效评估基于其团队满足应用程序开发和部署目标的能力。

## 3: Create real-time project visibility

## 3：创建实时项目可见性

Contemporary project management software now has built-in automation that eases the tedium of doing project updates. Project management tools can provide real-time visibility into an application and exactly where it is in the development to deployment process. It can also display who and what are the mission-critical resources for the current tasks at hand. The project management software can serve as a "single version of the truth" for a cross-functional IT team, making the job of project coordination easier.

现代项目管理软件现在具有内置的自动化功能，可以减轻进行项目更新的乏味。项目管理工具可以提供对应用程序的实时可见性以及它在开发到部署过程中的确切位置。它还可以显示当前手头任务的关键任务资源是谁和什么。项目管理软件可以作为跨职能 IT 团队的“真相的单一版本”，使项目协调工作变得更加轻松。

## 4: Use software automation wherever you can

## 4：尽可能使用软件自动化

You can cut time, errors, and costs by selecting an application automation toolset that is compatible with your IT environment. This automation can be extended to app source code development, system and middleware configuration, and even database and networking changes. Important pre-production tests like regression testing and load testing prior to deployment can also be automated. This saves developers and operations personnel time and effort.

您可以通过选择与您的 IT 环境兼容的应用程序自动化工具集来减少时间、错误和成本。这种自动化可以扩展到应用程序源代码开发、系统和中间件配置，甚至数据库和网络更改。部署前的回归测试和负载测试等重要的生产前测试也可以自动化。这节省了开发人员和操作人员的时间和精力。

## 5: Choose tools that are compatible with each other

## 5：选择相互兼容的工具

The other caveat for using tools and automation with DevOps is that the information the tools produce on application and system status does not conflict. It is generally more effective to choose tools from a single vendor because the tools are already tightly integrated with each other. This improves the chances that the status an app developer receives on an application's health will correspond closely to what an operations person sees on the app in his or her world.

在 DevOps 中使用工具和自动化的另一个注意事项是，工具生成的关于应用程序和系统状态的信息不会冲突。从单一供应商处选择工具通常更有效，因为这些工具已经彼此紧密集成。这提高了应用程序开发人员收到的应用程序健康状态与操作人员在他或她的世界中在应用程序上看到的内容密切对应的机会。

## 6: Start with projects that are small and ensured for success

## 6：从小型且确保成功的项目开始

CIOs who endeavor to move IT culture away from silos need to make sure that the newly integrated DevOps work teams rack up some quick successes. This builds their belief and cooperation in the new methodology.

努力使 IT 文化摆脱孤岛的 CIO 需要确保新集成的 DevOps 工作团队取得一些快速成功。这建立了他们对新方法的信念和合作。

## 7: Don't forget the users! 

## 7：不要忘记用户！

The applications you're developing are for the end business. Without the critical support of business stakeholders, your DevOps works will be in jeopardy. Actively include end users throughout the DevOps process, from the time you sit down with them to define app requirements, through prototype development, unit testing integration/regression testing, training, and deployment.

您正在开发的应用程序用于最终业务。如果没有业务利益相关者的关键支持，您的 DevOps 工作将处于危险之中。在整个 DevOps 过程中积极让最终用户参与进来，从您与他们坐下来定义应用程序要求，到原型开发、单元测试集成/回归测试、培训和部署。

## 8: Collaboratively manage change

## 8：协作管理变更

When multiple parties collaborate in a rapid-paced development effort that engages prototyping and other tools, change to an app is going to happen. This is why an effective change management process is vital to every DevOps project. The moment an app change is asked for, the request should go out to everyone on the team, no matter which IT discipline they work in. This communication should be routed to end-user stakeholders as well.

当多方在涉及原型设计和其他工具的快节奏开发工作中进行协作时，就会发生对应用程序的更改。这就是为什么有效的变更管理流程对每个 DevOps 项目都至关重要的原因。在要求更改应用程序的那一刻，该请求应该发送给团队中的每个人，无论他们从事哪个 IT 学科。这种沟通也应该传递给最终用户利益相关者。

## 9: Continuously deploy applications

## 9：持续部署应用程序

DevOps is best leveraged in a continuous app deployment model where sites don't wait to bundle numerous enhancements into separate software releases but instead opt to continuously embellish and deliver revised applications. A continuous app delivery model with a strong change management system enables new app capabilities to be delivered to the business faster.

DevOps 在持续的应用程序部署模型中得到了最好的利用，在这种模型中，站点不会等待将众多增强功能捆绑到单独的软件版本中，而是选择不断修饰和交付修改后的应用程序。具有强大变更管理系统的持续应用程序交付模型可以更快地将新的应用程序功能交付给业务。

## 10: Create a service environment within the company

## 10：在公司内部创造服务环境

The days of the IT "glass house" are over. To stay relevant, IT must keep its finger on the pulse of the business users' needs and deliver apps that meet or exceed functionality and time-to-market expectations. It can do this if it changes its culture to stress the values of team effort, open communications, and commitment to customer satisfaction--even if the customer resides in an adjacent office.

IT“玻璃房”的时代已经结束。为了保持相关性，IT 必须密切关注业务用户需求的脉搏，并提供满足或超过功能和上市时间预期的应用程序。如果它改变其文化以强调团队努力、开放式沟通和对客户满意度的承诺的价值观，即使客户住在相邻的办公室，它也可以做到这一点。
