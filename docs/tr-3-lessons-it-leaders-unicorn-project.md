# 来自“独角兽项目”的 IT 领导者的 3 个教训

Gene Kim’s new book brings us back to fictional company Parts Unlimited, where lead developer Maxine experiences frustrations that ring all too true. What can you take away for your DevOps and digital transformation work? Plenty

Gene Kim 的新书将我们带回了虚构的 Parts Unlimited 公司，在那里，首席开发人员 Maxine 经历了非常真实的挫折。您可以为 DevOps 和数字化转型工作带来什么？很多

November 11, 2019

Five stars, two thumbs up, and git commit. I breezed through reading Gene Kim's “ [The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-unicorn-project/),” much like I couldn't put “ [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/)” down. I love Kim's writing style and the way he contrasts the reality of an entrenched corporate environment built for rules, stability, and process with a [DevOps](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/76) world that wants to meet the organizational objectives, focus on the customer, and execute the CEO's vision.

五颗星，两个竖起大拇指，然后 git commit。我轻松地阅读了 Gene Kim 的“[独角兽计划](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-unicorn-project/)”，就像我不能把“[凤凰计划](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-unicorn-project/)”itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/)”。我喜欢 Kim 的写作风格，以及他将一个为规则、稳定性和流程而构建的根深蒂固的企业环境的现实与一个想要满足的 [DevOps](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/76) 世界进行对比的方式组织目标，以客户为中心，执行 CEO 的愿景。

Maxine is exiled from a great engineering position to the bowels of a “key" project and told to “lay low.”

Maxine 从一个伟大的工程职位被放逐到一个“关键”项目的内部，并被告知要“低调”。

The [book](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-unicorn-project/), which will be available on Nov. 26, is billed as “a novel about developers, digital disruption, and thriving in the age of data.” From the beginning of lead character Maxine’s exile from a great engineering position in Parts Unlimited to the bowels of a “key” project to change the company’s trajectory, where she was then told to “lay low,” I was hooked on the storyline.

[book](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-unicorn-project/) 将于 11 月 26 日上市，被称为“一部关于开发者、数字颠覆和繁荣时代的小说。数据。”从主角 Maxine 从 Parts Unlimited 的一个伟大工程职位流放到改变公司发展轨迹的“关键”项目的内部，然后她被告知“低调”，我被故事情节吸引住了。

I’ve been in some of those meetings. I’ve experienced some of those frustrations. Many of the scenarios in the book reminded me of the experiences described in “ [Disrupted](https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/dan-lyons/disrupted/9780316306072/)” by Dan Lyons  –  more so because of the reality of the tech industry.

我参加过其中一些会议。我经历过其中一些挫折。书中的许多场景让我想起了 Dan Lyons 在“[Disrupted](https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/dan-lyons/disrupted/9780316306072/)”中描述的经历 – 更是如此，因为科技行业的现实。

## Three takeaways from “The Unicorn Project”

## “独角兽项目”的三个要点

### 1\. Learn the Five Ideals

### 1\.学习五个理想

My absolute favorite part of the book was how Kim intertwined what he calls the Five Ideals throughout the entire story. In a blog, Kim [describes](https://itrevolution.com/announcing-the-unicorn-project-and-availability-of-first-excerpt-and-the-five-ideals/) these ideals as a way “ to frame what I think are the most important problems facing engineering and business today:”

这本书中我最喜欢的部分是金如何在整个故事中将他所谓的五个理想交织在一起。在博客中，Kim [描述](https://itrevolution.com/annoucing-the-unicorn-project-and-availability-of-first-excerpt-and-the-five-ideals/)将这些理想作为一种方式“我认为当今工程和商业面临的最重要问题是：”

- The first ideal: Locality and simplicity
- The second ideal: Focus, flow, and joy
- The third ideal: Improvement of daily work
- The fourth ideal: Psychological safety
- The fifth ideal: Customer focus

- 第一个理想：局部性和简单性
- 第二个理想：专注、流畅、快乐
- 第三个理想：改善日常工作
- 第四个理想：心理安全
- 第五个理想：以客户为中心

The only thing I wanted more of was some of the executive conversations that happened: These helped transform the fictional Parts Unlimited organization from a stale, dying company on the brink of extinction to a learning organization lead by elite members of the IT organization, who freed themselves of archaic processes that had dug their own grave.

我唯一想要更多的是发生的一些高管对话：这些帮助将虚构的 Parts Unlimited 组织从一家濒临灭绝的陈旧、垂死的公司转变为一个由 IT 组织的精英成员领导的学习型组织，他们解放了他们自己挖掘了自己的坟墓的古老过程。

If your organization is not familiar with the Five Ideals, learn them now. Start to look at ways to incorporate them into your teams. There are numerous examples throughout the book that you can apply.

如果您的组织不熟悉五个理想，现在就学习它们。开始寻找将它们整合到您的团队中的方法。整本书中有许多示例可供您应用。

### 2\. Avoid death by process

### 2. 避免因过程而死亡

It was obvious to me, as someone who works in tech and is able to incorporate DevOps and agile practices into my everyday work, how “the Rebellion” (a group of the best and brightest engineers in the company, training in secret to become a learning organization) was able to foster change and show the organization how to execute on key business objectives. For someone who doesn’t live in that environment, or for someone who strives to work like “the Rebellion” team, this book can help lead you to a path where work can be fun, simple, safe, and rewarding.

作为一名从事技术工作并且能够将 DevOps 和敏捷实践融入我的日常工作的人，我很清楚“叛乱”（公司中一群最优秀、最聪明的工程师，通过秘密培训成为一名学习型组织）能够促进变革并向组织展示如何执行关键业务目标。对于没有生活在那种环境中的人，或者对于像“反叛”团队那样努力工作的人来说，这本书可以帮助您走上一条有趣、简单、安全和有益的工作之路。

Does your organization have a “nothing gets through” review board?

您的组织是否有“一事无成”的审查委员会？

How did the Rebellion team do it? There were many examples where they were able to “hack” the system and circumvent existing processes put in place to address past problems. The company never took the opportunity to reflect on how these rules and processes were impacting the business in a negative way. 

Rebellion 团队是如何做到的？有很多例子表明他们能够“破解”系统并绕过为解决过去的问题而制定的现有流程。该公司从未借此机会反思这些规则和流程如何以负面方式影响业务。

My favorite example from the book was the IT review board (called the TEP-LARB: Technology Evaluation Process-Lead Architecture Review Board) – or as Kim so eloquently described it, the “nothing gets through” board. This group served as the ultimate blocker to innovation in the organization. If you don’t have a progressive IT review board, then you may want to consider dismantling it or revising its role in your organization.

书中我最喜欢的例子是 IT 审查委员会（称为 TEP-LARB：技术评估流程-领导架构审查委员会）——或者正如 Kim 雄辩地描述的那样，“没有通过”委员会。这个群体是组织创新的终极障碍。如果您没有渐进式 IT 审查委员会，那么您可能需要考虑拆除它或修改其在组织中的角色。

If your IT team is saddled with too much process, find ways to implement the first and fourth ideals. Reduce the amount of overhead with processes, forms, and dependencies and figure out how teams get working with simplified and streamlined processes. And of course, making sure teams feel safe being honest and blameless about problems and solutions is critical.

如果您的 IT 团队背负着过多的流程，请找到实现第一个和第四个理想的方法。减少流程、表单和依赖项的开销，并弄清楚团队如何使用简化和精简的流程。当然，确保团队对问题和解决方案保持诚实和无可指责是安全的。

### 3\. Realize the power of self-organization

### 3. 实现自组织的力量

Although not explicit in the book, there’s an underlying theme about self-organization. The team members that made up “the Rebellion” were opting in to project tasks where their expertise was a good fit or where they wanted to learn more.

虽然书中没有明确说明，但有一个关于自组织的潜在主题。组成“叛乱”的团队成员选择参与他们的专业知识非常适合或想要了解更多信息的项目任务。

If you're familiar with “ [The Open Organization](https://www.redhat.com/en/explore/the-open-organization-book?intcmp=701f2000000tjyaAAA),” by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en?intcmp=701f2000000tjyaAAA) CEO Jim Whitehurst, this sort of opt-in culture translates to strong self-organization, where people work on things they're passionate about and which matter to the customer.

如果您熟悉 [The Open Organization](https://www.redhat.com/en/explore/the-open-organization-book?intcmp=701f2000000tjyaAAA)，[Red Hat] 首席执行官吉姆怀特赫斯特，这种选择加入的文化转化为强大的自组织，人们致力于他们热衷的事情并且对客户很重要。

The team focused on finding the workflow with the least resistance that was repeatable.

该团队专注于寻找可重复的阻力最小的工作流程。

The second and fourth ideals are very important to foster self-organization. The team members in “the Rebellion” didn’t really let the org chart get in the way. They focused on the best way to approach a challenge to solve a customer problem, and streamlined their work to put more focus on their customer.

第二个和第四个理想对于促进自组织非常重要。 “叛乱”中的团队成员并没有真正让组织结构图妨碍到他们。他们专注于应对挑战以解决客户问题的最佳方式，并简化他们的工作以更加关注客户。

The team focused on finding the workflow with the least resistance that was repeatable: That’s particularly important when we’re talking about development build environments and production deployments.

该团队专注于寻找可重复的阻力最小的工作流程：当我们谈论开发构建环境和生产部署时，这一点尤为重要。

### Refreshing and realistic ideas

### 令人耳目一新的现实想法

For organizations looking to start a [digital transformation](https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-digital-transformation?sc_cid=70160000000h0axaaq "What is digital transformation?"), “The Unicorn Project” may introduce you to the moonshot company you've been waiting for to model your organization after. Yes, it’s a fictitious story, but it’s based on the reality of many tech constraints today, plus the dramatic realities of corporate deadbeats who want to protect their budget and the way things have always been done.

对于希望开始[数字化转型](https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-digital-transformation?sc_cid=70160000000h0axaaq“什么是数字化转型？”)的组织，“独角兽项目”可能会向您介绍登月计划您一直在等待为您的组织建模的公司。是的，这是一个虚构的故事，但它基于当今许多技术限制的现实，以及想要保护预算和一直做事的方式的企业无赖的戏剧性现实。

It was refreshing to read about the ideas, possibilities, and energy from a group of IT leaders who wanted to create positive change for their organization. This is what’s needed in the corporate world, and I would extend that to small businesses too. As many of us have heard from Patrick Fisher, [all companies are technology companies now](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/all-companies-are-technology-companies-now/). And if they don’t realize that, they are in jeopardy. If they read “The Unicorn Project” and don’t get it, they’re doomed.

读到一群希望为他们的组织创造积极变革的 IT 领导者的想法、可能性和能量，令人耳目一新。这是企业界所需要的，我也会将其扩展到小型企业。正如我们许多人从 Patrick Fisher 那里听到的那样，[现在所有公司都是技术公司](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/all-companies-are-technology-companies-now/)。如果他们没有意识到这一点，他们就处于危险之中。如果他们读了《独角兽计划》却没有明白，他们就完蛋了。

Enjoy the story, and if you’re in the middle of a digital transformation, I hope this book can propel your organization to make the next leap in progress, or offer an example to apply to your journey.

享受这个故事吧，如果您正处于数字化转型之中，我希望这本书可以推动您的组织在进步中实现下一个飞跃，或者提供一个适用于您的旅程的例子。
