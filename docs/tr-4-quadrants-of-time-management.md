People do things differently, but do you know what most of us have in common?

人们做事不同，但你知道我们大多数人有什么共同点吗？

We do the most urgent things first, not considering if it’s the most important. You may say yes, it’s normal because that is how things are usually done.

我们先做最紧急的事情，而不考虑它是否最重要。你可能会说是的，这很正常，因为事情通常就是这样完成的。

Truth is you’re wrong. Here’s why: There are classifications in everything you do in life.

事实是你错了。原因如下：你在生活中所做的每一件事都有分类。

First is the urgency of the matter (urgent or not urgent) and second, by its importance (important or not important).

首先是事情的紧急程度（紧急或不紧急），其次是其重要性（重要或不重要）。

We can then create these [time management](https://weekplan.net/time-tracking/) quadrants:

然后我们可以创建这些 [时间管理](https://weekplan.net/time-tracking/) 象限：

![Time Management Matrix Important not important information](http://weekplan.net/assets/images/uploads/time-matrix-edited.jpg)

1. **First are matters that are Important and Urgent**. These are things such as crises, emergencies or deadlines. Remember that business proposal you worked overtime because it’s due the next day? This is an example of a matter that should be done right now. But it was stressful, right? But remember it was given weeks before the deadline? This is to point out how important matters should be addressed before they become urgent to avoid stress and conflicts.
2. **The second are matters that are Important but Not Urgent.** This is where you should focus and spend your time on. It is all about [planning](https://weekplan.net/). Addressing these matters helps you do the task more effectively. And in doing so, you actually learn more out of those tasks. This is a quadrant of opportunities, opportunity to learn, to improve yourself or your relationship with people and seeing what’s in store for you.
3. **Third are matters that are Not Important but Urgent**. This is where most of us sit. We tend to focus on matters that are urgent without thinking if it’s important. The problem with this is we lose track of the important matters. That phone call amidst your date with your wife, it deviates you from what you should be prioritizing at the moment. It affects your priorities just because it’s urgent.
4. **Lastly are matters that are Not Important and Not Urgent.** Obviously, these are what they call time wasters. Thus, these are mostly matters you shouldn’t spend so much time on, like that mindless Facebook-scrolling or you binge-watching movies. These matters aren’t really that helpful to you so it would be useful to limit your time on these things.



1. **首先是重要和紧急的事情**。这些是诸如危机、紧急情况或最后期限之类的事情。还记得你加班的商业提案，因为它是第二天到期吗？这是现在应该做的事情的一个例子。但是压力很大，对吧？但还记得它是在截止日期前几周给出的吗？这是为了指出在事情变得紧迫之前应该如何处理重要的事情以避免压力和冲突。
2. **第二个是重要但不紧急的事情。**这是你应该关注和花时间的地方。这完全是关于[计划](https://weekplan.net/)。解决这些问题有助于您更有效地完成任务。通过这样做，您实际上可以从这些任务中学到更多。这是机会的象限，学习的机会，可以改善自己或与人的关系，并了解为您准备的东西。
3. **第三是不重要但紧急的事情**。这是我们大多数人坐的地方。我们倾向于关注紧急的事情，而不考虑它是否重要。这样做的问题是我们忘记了重要的事情。在你与妻子约会期间打来的电话，它偏离了你目前应该优先考虑的事情。它会影响您的优先事项，因为它很紧急。
4. **最后是不重要和不紧急的事情。** 显然，这些就是他们所说的浪费时间的事情。因此，这些大多是你不应该花太多时间在上面的事情，比如盲目的 Facebook 滚动或你狂看电影。这些事情对你并没有多大帮助，所以限制你在这些事情上的时间会很有用。

This decision matrix, also known as the 4 Quadrants of Time Management matrix, is the brainchild of Dwight Eisenhower, the decorated army general and President of the United States.

这个决策矩阵，也称为时间管理矩阵的 4 个象限，是德怀特·艾森豪威尔 (Dwight Eisenhower) 的心血结晶，他是美国陆军上将和总统。

He said we should identify ourselves with several roles. You can be a husband, a mother, a daughter or a businessman.

他说我们应该用几个角色来确定自己。你可以是丈夫、母亲、女儿或商人。

These roles can change though. They depend on what you consider as a priority. These priorities would serve as guides for the tasks at hand for each role.

不过，这些角色可能会发生变化。它们取决于您认为优先事项。这些优先事项将作为每个角色手头任务的指南。

Let’s say your priority as of the moment is being a mother, you then spend more time taking care of your children.

假设您目前的首要任务是成为一名母亲，然后您会花更多时间照顾您的孩子。

Additionally, other roles would need to cope up with the change in priority. Your awareness for each role and your priority lets you balance everything.

此外，其他角色需要应对优先级的变化。您对每个角色和优先级的认识可以让您平衡一切。

Also, if you are looking to better manage time - consider investing in [time tracking software](https://allthatsaas.com/roundup/best-time-tracking-software/) for yourself and your team. With an app that helps you keep track of time spent on tasks, you can analyze what tasks consume most of your work hours, what are the priorities for your team, and how you can cut down on time spent to get things done.

此外，如果您希望更好地管理时间 - 考虑为您自己和您的团队投资 [时间跟踪软件](https://allthatsaas.com/roundup/best-time-tracking-software/)。借助可帮助您跟踪任务时间的应用程序，您可以分析哪些任务占用了您的大部分工作时间、您团队的优先事项是什么，以及如何减少完成工作所花费的时间。

All in all, Eisenhower’s purpose for the four Quadrants time matrix is to achieve real progress in life. Life isn’t just about being an employee or a boss. It’s a mix of everything. By ensuring harmony between the roles, we can achieve our goals. 

总而言之，艾森豪威尔提出四象限时间矩阵的目的是为了实现人生真正的进步。生活不仅仅是成为一名员工或老板。它是一切的混合体。通过确保角色之间的和谐，我们可以实现我们的目标。
