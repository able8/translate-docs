爱它或离开它，“[DevOps](https://enterprisersproject.com/tags/devops)工程师”的头衔——仍然在 IT 专业人士之间激起争论——将在 2021 年继续存在。它是最热门和 [最难填补的](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/9/devops-engineer-hiring-tips) 2020 年 IT 职位。

Today, job boards show loads of open DevOps engineer positions (and  similar titles or roles). That means there will be many DevOps engineer  interviews, and they come with considerations for both the interviewers  and candidates.

今天，工作板显示了大量开放的 DevOps 工程师职位（以及类似的头衔或角色）。这意味着会有很多 DevOps 工程师面试，面试官和候选人都会考虑。

What do DevOps hiring managers seek? "The number-one trait they look for is team fit."

DevOps 招聘经理寻求什么？ “他们寻找的第一要素是团队配合。”

Ravi Lachhman, evangelist at [Harness](https://harness.io/), notes an intrinsic challenge in DevOps interviews for both sides of the table: The DevOps engineer title is inherently broad. Both the hiring  manager and the interviewee need to develop questions and answers  accordingly, and expand their horizons beyond the traditional technical  interview.

[Harness](https://harness.io/) 的布道者 Ravi Lachman 指出，DevOps 面试中的内在挑战对双方来说都是如此：DevOps 工程师的职位本身就很宽泛。招聘经理和面试者都需要相应地制定问题和答案，并在传统的技术面试之外扩展他们的视野。

“I’ve been pretty fortunate to recently talk to a series of DevOps  leaders around their hiring practices,” Lachhman says. “The number-one  trait they look for is team fit.”

“我很幸运最近与一系列 DevOps 领导者讨论了他们的招聘实践，”Lachhman 说。 “他们寻找的第一要素是团队配合。”

While job seekers should anticipate technical questions around tools  and processes, the people part of the equation is just as important, if  not more: How do your individual traits bolster the team you’re looking  to join? There is likely less perceived value in ‘I know all the tools!” than in “Here’s how I’ve helped reduce operational complexity” or  “Here’s how I’ve helped different teams better work together toward  common goals.”

虽然求职者应该预见到有关工具和流程的技术问题，但等式中的人员部分同样重要，甚至更多：您的个人特征如何支持您希望加入的团队？ “我知道所有工具！”的感知价值可能较低。而不是“这就是我如何帮助降低运营复杂性”或“这是我如何帮助不同团队更好地为共同目标而合作”。

“DevOps teams continue to scale, and meeting the demands of the  engineering organization and the business side of the house takes grit,” Lachhman says. “No one person can have the entire end-to-end expertise  in every system and platform that the team builds and supports. Working  as a team and having an open mind is critical, and most of the time  there will be more than one hand in the DevOps team delivering  functionality or infrastructure.”

“DevOps 团队不断扩大规模，满足工程组织和公司业务方面的需求需要勇气，”Lachhman 说。 “在团队构建和支持的每个系统和平台中，没有人可以拥有完整的端到端专业知识。作为一个团队工作并保持开放的心态至关重要，而且在大多数情况下，DevOps 团队中会有不止一只手在提供功能或基础设施。”

Let’s dig in:

让我们深入了解：

## 1. What did you do to exceed expectations in your last role? What  opportunities did you have (and take) to improve your outcomes? 

## 1. 在上一个角色中，您做了哪些超出预期的事情？您有（并利用）哪些机会来改善您的成果？

[Eveline Oehrlich](https://enterprisersproject.com/user/202521),chief research director at [DevOps Institute](https://devopsinstitute.com/), says that the first and final questions in an interview are especially important since psychology ([serial-position effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect)by [Herman Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus)) shows they will be the easiest to recall later. As a result, they can  have a lasting impact on the perception of the interview for both sides. Oehrlich suggests this one as a lead question, while bearing in mind  that 2020 was a trying year for many individuals and organizations  alike.

[Eveline Oehrlich](https://enterprisersproject.com/user/202521)，[DevOpsInstitute](https://devopsinstitute.com/) 首席研究总监表示，面试中的第一个问题和最后一个问题尤为重要因为心理学（[序列位置效应](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect）由[HermanEbbinghaus]（https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus）)表明他们会以后最容易回忆起来。因此，它们可以对双方对面试的看法产生持久的影响。 Oehrlich 建议将此作为一个主要问题，同时牢记 2020 年对许多个人和组织来说都是艰难的一年。

“This will show what abilities a person has, above and beyond  mastering a role,” Oehrlich says. “The demand for people who are able to change, be creative, flexible, and driven is one of the top 10  must-have skills from our research at the DevOps Institute.”

Oehrlich 说：“这将显示一个人拥有的能力，超越掌握一个角色。” “对能够改变、有创造力、灵活和有动力的人的需求是我们在 DevOps 研究所研究的 10 大必备技能之一。”

DevOps is not about one concentrated skill or platform; this question opens a wide door to learning how someone approaches a role, solves  problems, and so forth.

DevOps 不是一种集中的技能或平台；这个问题为了解某人如何接近角色、解决问题等打开了一扇大门。

“As things still will be difficult in 2021 given our global situation on jobs, skills, pandemic, and financial situations, it is essential  that the person we hire is empathetic and can adjust to different  situations,” Oehrlich says, adding that this question is also an  invitation to discuss additional skills or experience that might be  relevant to the position, beyond the core requirements of the job  description.

“鉴于我们在就业、技能、流行病和财务状况方面的全球形势，到 2021 年事情仍然会很困难，因此我们雇用的人必须具有同情心并且能够适应不同的情况，”Oehrlich 说，并补充说这个问题是还邀请讨论可能与职位相关的其他技能或经验，超出职位描述的核心要求。

“The interviewer can follow up with specific questions on what was  the person’s favorite part of the previous position and, if suitable,  what was a challenge,” Oehrlich says. “Of course, smart interviewees  turn this around into a positive, [such as] 'I am very detail-oriented  and because of that take a lot of care when I work on a specific  project.' This will also allow an insight into the employees' desire to  learn.”

Oehrlich 说：“面试官可以跟进具体问题，了解该人在之前职位中最喜欢的部分是什么，如果合适，还有什么挑战。” “当然，聪明的面试者会把这变成积极的，[例如]'我非常注重细节，因此在我从事特定项目时会非常小心。'这也将有助于深入了解员工的学习欲望。”

## 2. Tell me an initiative you can spearhead that will improve DevOps workflow

## 2. 告诉我一个你可以带头改进 DevOps 工作流程的计划

No matter the specifics of the role, most DevOps pros are obsessive  about continuous improvement throughout the software delivery pipeline  and the related infrastructure. Here’s a chance to show how you identify and go about implementing those kinds of improvements. Experienced  DevOps pros could obviously share real-world examples; someone trying to break into their first position could use a hypothetical. Regardless,  automation is one area to stress.

无论角色的具体情况如何，大多数 DevOps 专业人员都痴迷于整个软件交付管道和相关基础设施的持续改进。这是一个展示您如何识别和实施这些改进的机会。经验丰富的 DevOps 专家显然可以分享真实世界的例子；试图闯入他们的第一个位置的人可以使用假设。无论如何，自动化是一个需要强调的领域。

“A DevOps engineer should be prepared (and eager) to find specific  areas where automation can streamline processes in 2021, even if that  means suggesting team reorganizations to better align with cloud-native  pipeline workflows,” says Glen Kosaka, VP of product at [ NeuVector](https://neuvector.com/). “Many DevOps functions all along the CI/CD pipeline and into production – from security to operations to compliance management – need to be  organized more efficiently in order to eliminate manual processes or  configurations that are impeding progress or unnecessarily hogging  DevOps’ time.”

“DevOps 工程师应该做好准备（并渴望）在 2021 年找到自动化可以简化流程的特定领域，即使这意味着建议团队重组以更好地与云原生管道工作流保持一致，” [... NeuVector](https://neuvector.com/)。 “许多 DevOps 功能贯穿 CI/CD 管道并进入生产——从安全到运营再到合规管理——需要更有效地组织起来，以消除阻碍进度或不必要地占用 DevOps 时间的手动流程或配置。”

This is the kind of question that helps differentiate between someone who’s good at talking tools and processes versus someone who  understands how those tools and processes can produce tangible results. They can discuss not just the “what” of DevOps but the “how” and “why,”  especially when it comes to automation.

这种问题有助于区分擅长谈论工具和流程的人与了解这些工具和流程如何产生切实结果的人。他们不仅可以讨论 DevOps 的“什么”，还可以讨论“如何”和“为什么”，尤其是在涉及自动化时。

“The gains to be had are big at many enterprises, and DevOps  engineers should make the case for being proactive – or at least ready  and willing – in 2021 to place every activity and requirement under  scrutiny for more automation,” Kosaka says.

“许多企业将获得巨大收益，DevOps 工程师应该在 2021 年积极主动——或者至少准备好并愿意——对每一项活动和需求进行审查，以实现更多自动化，”Kosaka 说。

## 3. Describe a time you chose to build out a solution rather than buy, and the factors that went into the decision 

## 3. 描述您选择构建解决方案而不是购买的时间，以及影响该决定的因素

Questions that not only reveal someone’s technical chops but also how those skills intersect with critical thinking abilities are key in  DevOps interviews. Asking about the build-versus-buy choice IT teams  regularly make is a good way to dig into that relationship.

在 DevOps 面试中，问题不仅能揭示某人的技术能力，还能揭示这些技能如何与批判性思维能力相交。询问 IT 团队经常做出的构建与购买选择是深入了解这种关系的好方法。

“This question helps shed light into their thought process and  decision-making abilities,” says Abby Boyle, director of recruiting at [ReliaQuest](https://www.reliaquest.com/). “Have they done their due diligence and considered all options or  alternatives? Have they weighed out each option to determine which  solution is best and the most ROI? Finally, have they given thought to  maintainability with the solution they’ve built and how that applies to  the team or company in the future?”

“这个问题有助于阐明他们的思维过程和决策能力，”[ReliaQuest](https://www.reliaquest.com/) 的招聘主管 Abby Boyle 说。 “他们是否进行了尽职调查并考虑了所有选择或替代方案？他们是否权衡了每个选项以确定哪种解决方案最好且投资回报率最高？最后，他们是否考虑过他们构建的解决方案的可维护性以及未来如何应用于团队或公司？”

## 4. Describe a deploy pipeline for a three-tier web application

## 4. 描述三层 Web 应用程序的部署管道

Arjun Narayan, co-founder and CEO of streaming SQL database [Materialize](https://materialize.com/), says this is a question his firm asks in any DevOps or SRE interviews. It serves here as an example of how interviewers and candidates should  be prepared to dig into skills and experience that apply to the  company’s specific technology products or stack.

流式 SQL 数据库 [Materialize](https://materialize.com/) 的联合创始人兼首席执行官 Arjun Narayan 说，这是他的公司在任何 DevOps 或 SRE 采访中都会提出的问题。它在这里作为一个例子，说明面试官和候选人应该如何准备挖掘适用于公司特定技术产品或堆栈的技能和经验。

The prompt is born out of Materialize’s customer-facing web  application, which consists of three pieces: a React single-page  application, a Ruby on Rails API backend, and a PostgreSQL database.

该提示源自 Materialise 面向客户的 Web 应用程序，该应用程序由三部分组成：React 单页应用程序、Ruby on Rails API 后端和 PostgreSQL 数据库。

“The backend and frontend are in different directories of the same  repository. Our application developers have already written a test suite with good coverage for both the frontend and backend and would like new changes pushed to the main branch to automatically deploy the new code  to production,” Narayan says. “As part of the interview, we’d ask a  candidate: How would you host the three components? How would you deploy changes to the code and database schema? How would you scale the  application to handle 1,000x the current number of users?”

“后端和前端位于同一存储库的不同目录中。我们的应用程序开发人员已经编写了一个对前端和后端都具有良好覆盖率的测试套件，并且希望将新更改推送到主分支以自动将新代码部署到生产中，”Narayan 说。 “作为面试的一部分，我们会问候选人：你会如何主持这三个部分？您将如何部署对代码和数据库架构的更改？您将如何扩展应用程序以处理当前用户数量的 1,000 倍？”

Again, the wording of this particular prompt or question will vary  depending on the product or stack the person will be working with in a  given position. But Narayan says it’s a wide-ranging prompt that gives  the candidate a chance to show off their skills and knowledge, rather  than an interview “gotcha” or a nitty-gritty technical test.

同样，此特定提示或问题的措辞将根据人员将在给定职位上使用的产品或堆栈而有所不同。但 Narayan 表示，这是一个范围广泛的提示，让候选人有机会炫耀他们的技能和知识，而不是面试“陷阱”或详细的技术测试。

“We’re really trying to allow space for a candidate to focus on their strengths and previous experience rather than trying to suss out their  weaknesses,” Narayan says. “By providing a candidate with a broad prompt and attempting to drill in for depth somewhere they are comfortable, we feel that the candidate will have a better experience and the interview will be more substantial than if you try to test simply for subject  matter expertise. ”

“我们真的在努力为候选人留出空间，让他们专注于自己的优势和以往的经验，而不是试图找出他们的弱点，”Narayan 说。 “通过向候选人提供广泛的提示并尝试在他们感到舒适的地方深入了解，我们认为候选人将拥有更好的体验，并且与您仅尝试测试主题专业知识相比，面试将更加充实。 ”

Let’s dig into six more questions, starting with your ability to build consensus:

让我们再深入研究六个问题，从你建立共识的能力开始：

## 5, 6, and 7: A trio of related questions

## 5、6 和 7：三个相关问题

### How do you go about building consensus?

### 你如何建立共识？

### How do you take feedback? Is there a time that you had negative feedback and what was your response?

### 你如何接受反馈？你有没有收到负面反馈的时候，你的反应是什么？

### How do you learn and keep up with industry trends?

### 您如何学习并跟上行业趋势？

Lachhman points to each of these three related questions as examples  that are equally important for DevOps hiring managers and candidates. Each speaks to the practical realities of a DevOps engineer position and DevOps culture overall. Continuous learning speaks for itself; if you  can’t respond to that question, you’re sending up a red flag.

Lachhman 指出这三个相关问题中的每一个都作为对 DevOps 招聘经理和候选人同样重要的示例。每个人都谈到了 DevOps 工程师职位和 DevOps 文化的实际现实。持续学习不言自明；如果你不能回答这个问题，你就是在发出危险信号。

The question about consensus-building ties to the interdisciplinary  nature of DevOps roles and the need to be able to work well across  functions and stakeholders, Lachhman says. Not everyone has the patience required to get buy-in for changes that will impact an entire team or  organization, for example.

Lachhman 说，关于建立共识的问题与 DevOps 角色的跨学科性质以及能够跨职能和利益相关者良好合作的需要有关。例如，并不是每个人都有耐心来接受会影响整个团队或组织的变化。

“Dealing with lots of engineers can be like herding cats,” Lachhman says. “Lots of opinions and priorities can fly around.” 

“与大量工程师打交道就像放牧一样，”Lachhman 说。 “很多意见和优先事项可以四处飞扬。”

Lastly, the feedback question is inherently worthwhile to DevOps  culture, but it is perhaps especially valuable if you’re interviewing  someone who is transitioning from, say, a traditional software engineer  role into a DevOps job. Lachhman notes that a person might be used to  hearing feedback only in code/sprint reviews, rather than the more  frequent feedback loops they might encounter as a DevOps engineer or  related role like SRE.

最后，反馈问题对于 DevOps 文化来说本质上是有价值的，但如果你正在面试一个正在从传统软件工程师角色转变为 DevOps 工作的人，它可能特别有价值。 Lachhman 指出，一个人可能习惯于只在代码/冲刺审查中听到反馈，而不是他们作为 DevOps 工程师或相关角色（如 SRE）可能遇到的更频繁的反馈循环。

“As a DevOps engineer with potentially more internal customers, feedback is certainly to come more often,” Lachhman says.

“作为拥有更多内部客户的 DevOps 工程师，反馈肯定会更频繁，”Lachhman 说。

## 8. What is the biggest challenge you faced in your previous position or team? How did you overcome it?

## 8. 您在之前的职位或团队中面临的最大挑战是什么？你是怎么克服的？

If the first and final questions have the most influence on the  overall feel and substance of an interview, this is Oehrlich’s  suggestion for a closing prompt.

如果第一个问题和最后一个问题对面试的整体感觉和内容影响最大，这就是 Oehrlich 对结束提示的建议。

“This is great as the last question as it can expose a variety of  skills such as problem-solving, communication, collaboration, learning,  and styles – all top must-have skills for a DevOps [professional] or any human going into 2021, ” Oehrlich says.

“作为最后一个问题，这很好，因为它可以展示各种技能，例如解决问题、沟通、协作、学习和风格——这些都是 DevOps [专业人士] 或任何进入 2021 年的人必备的顶级技能， ”欧利希说。

Oehrlich notes that a candidate who’s on top of things will also  return this question to the interviewer: “What’s the toughest challenge  your team is facing right now?”

Oehrlich 指出，处于领先地位的候选人也会向面试官回答这个问题：“你的团队目前面临的最严峻的挑战是什么？”

This can produce insight into the day-to-day realities of the  position and organization, including potential warning signs about  cultural problems or other issues.

这可以深入了解职位和组织的日常现实，包括有关文化问题或其他问题的潜在警告信号。

“This could make or break the deal,” Oehrlich says. “I asked that  question one time and I learned that there was a lot of bureaucracy  within an organization [that impeded people’s ability] to get things  done. Even though the position was excellent, with great benefits and a  super-cool challenge, I was no longer interested.”

“这可能决定交易的成败，”Oehrlich 说。 “有一次我问了这个问题，我了解到组织内有很多官僚作风[阻碍了人们完成工作的能力]。尽管这个职位非常好，有很大的好处，还有一个超酷的挑战，但我已经不感兴趣了。”

## 9. Why are you hiring?

## 9. 你为什么要招聘？

But wait, you said that was the final question of the interview.

但是等等，你说这是面试的最后一个问题。

Not so fast: Extending Oehrlich’s anecdote, it’s important for DevOps engineer candidates to ask questions of their own. While this is common advice for most job interviews, Lachhman says it’s especially critical  for DevOps roles because the title can mean very different things to  different people. It’s the proverbial wide paintbrush.

没那么快：扩展 Oehrlich 的轶事，DevOps 工程师候选人提出自己的问题很重要。虽然这是大多数工作面试的常见建议，但 Lachhman 表示这对 DevOps 角色尤其重要，因为头衔对不同的人来说可能意味着非常不同的事情。这是众所周知的宽画笔。

This big-picture question, suggested by Lachhman, could reveal a lot  about the hiring manager, the team, or the organization – whether the  reasons are good, bad, or ugly.

这个由 Lachhman 提出的宏观问题可以揭示很多关于招聘经理、团队或组织的信息——无论原因是好的、坏的还是丑陋的。

“This is a loaded question that can expose a lot about the team and  workload,” Lachhman says. “Are they hiring because they want to scale  the team and hit the limits on what they can achieve? Did someone leave  and they are forced to backfill? Are they looking to bring on additional skill sets that they do not have?”

“这是一个沉重的问题，可以暴露很多关于团队和工作量的信息，”Lachhman 说。 “他们招聘是因为他们想扩大团队规模并达到他们所能达到的极限吗？是否有人离开并被迫回填？他们是否希望带来他们没有的额外技能？”

## 10. How much of this job is on-call?

## 10. 这项工作有多少是随叫随到的？

This is a good way to dig into an organization's philosophy (or  possible lack thereof) on work-life balance without actually using the  phrase “work-life balance” directly, which could produce a canned answer that obscures some of the realities of the job .

这是一种很好的方式，可以深入了解组织的工作与生活平衡理念（或可能缺乏这种理念），而无需实际直接使用“工作与生活平衡”这个短语，因为这可能会产生一个模糊的答案，掩盖了工作的某些现实.

“System engineering jobs usually have an on-call portion to their job if supporting production systems,” Lachhman says. “As the development  pipeline is viewed as critical for business, they are starting to be  treated like production systems with the [same] rigor and uptime  requirements as prod.”

“如果支持生产系统，系统工程工作通常会有随叫随到的部分，”Lachhman 说。 “由于开发管道被视为对业务至关重要，因此它们开始被视为具有 [相同] 严格性和正常运行时间要求的生产系统。”
