# Why did I leave Google or, why did I stay so long?

# 我为什么离开谷歌，或者，为什么我呆了这么久？

It's been two weeks since I left Google and I keep getting asked “why did I leave now”? I think the better question is “why did I stay for so long”? When Waze was acquired by Google, most of the people who know me did not believe I would last 7 weeks, let alone 7 years…

我离开谷歌已经两周了，我一直被问到“我为什么现在离开”？我认为更好的问题是“我为什么要呆这么久”？当 Waze 被谷歌收购时，大多数认识我的人都不相信我能坚持 7 周，更不用说 7 年了……

So the question of why I stayed has many different aspects to it. When we were evaluating the offers to sell the company, we asked ourselves what would really change by being acquired? Due to a bunch of mistakes early on, we did not own substantial amounts of equity and had a pretty bad relationship with some of our board members. I remember the bottom line: “wouldn't you rather work for Larry Page than our current board”? We were committed to our mission and saw this as a change in the cap table rather than a change of mission. This counted on the fact that Google had promised us autonomy to continue to act as Waze and we believed them.

所以我为什么留下的问题有很多不同的方面。当我们评估出售公司的报价时，我们问自己被收购后真正会改变什么？由于早期的一系列错误，我们没有拥有大量股权，并且与我们的一些董事会成员关系非常糟糕。我记得底线是：“你宁愿为拉里佩奇工作，也不愿为我们现在的董事会工作”？我们致力于我们的使命，并将其视为工资表的变化，而不是使命的变化。这依赖于这样一个事实，即谷歌向我们承诺继续充当 Waze 的自主权，我们相信他们。

This was the moment I realized what had happened and that we were part of acorporation

公司

**Autonomy**

**自治**

I saw independence as a critical aspect of our decision to sell. We loved our brand, mission and team and imagined continuing to work on it without the financial stress of fundraising. Being able to take more, not less, risk and experiment with new things on a longer time horizon. We assumed we would get jacked up distribution for our app through Google, basically the best of both worlds -  speed and culture of a start-up and financial backing and distribution of a corporation. This model of independence was not very popular in 2013 but very quickly became the model for tech acquisitions of branded products. Instagram, Whatsapp, Nest, Waze - we were all granted autonomy and retained most of our team. In all these cases, the founders stayed for quite a while.

我认为独立性是我们决定出售的一个关键方面。我们热爱我们的品牌、使命和团队，并想象在没有筹款的财务压力的情况下继续致力于它。能够承担更多而不是更少的风险，并在更长的时间范围内尝试新事物。我们假设我们会通过 Google 为我们的应用程序增加分销，这基本上是两全其美的 - 初创公司的速度和文化以及公司的财务支持和分销。这种独立模式在 2013 年并不流行，但很快成为品牌产品技术收购的模式。 Instagram、Whatsapp、Nest、Waze——我们都被授予了自主权，并保留了我们团队的大部分成员。在所有这些情况下，创始人都呆了很长一段时间。

Autonomy for us meant that we could continue to be open with our community, build the functionality we thought would work, retain our technology stack in the cloud (vs porting over to Google’s internal systems), keep our brand, our Terms and Conditions etc.

自主性对我们来说意味着我们可以继续对我们的社区开放，构建我们认为可行的功能，将我们的技术堆栈保留在云中（与移植到 Google 的内部系统相比），保留我们的品牌、我们的条款和条件等。

Google was true to their promise and gave us this autonomy. Although we did not remain as a separate legal entity but rather became Google employees, operating as a Google team (this was pre-Alphabet) but maintaining our independence.

谷歌信守诺言，给了我们这种自主权。尽管我们不再是一个独立的法律实体，而是成为了 Google 员工，作为一个 Google 团队运营（这是 Alphabet 之前的），但保持了我们的独立性。

I took the acquisition as a personal challenge. I believed that I could build out Waze within Google, breaking the myth about what happens to companies after being acquired by large corporations. Looking back, this reminds me of the Western CEO and China. Every Western CEO thinks she or he will be the first to be a successful Western brand in China and many try and launch a service there. The Chinese are used to this Western arrogance and welcome the foreigners. Many quarters and dollars later, the Western CEO leaves with some China experience and the Chinese partner keeps the IP, money, business... You cannot fight the nature of the beast, this is China. Same thing happened to me in China pre acquisition… So, to complete the analogy, I was the naive start-up leader believing that I can build out Waze within Google to its full potential and conquer the beast, regardless of its nature. This irrational belief is critical for a startup leader but challenging in the corporate environment.

我将此次收购视为个人挑战。我相信我可以在 Google 内部构建 Waze，打破关于公司被大公司收购后会发生什么的神话。回想起来，这让我想起了西方的 CEO 和中国。每个西方 CEO 都认为她或他将成为第一个在中国取得成功的西方品牌，许多人尝试在中国推出服务。中国人习惯了西方的这种傲慢，欢迎外国人。许多季度和美元之后，西方首席执行官带着一些中国经验离开，中国合作伙伴保留了知识产权、金钱、业务……你无法对抗野兽的本性，这就是中国。同样的事情发生在我被收购前的中国......所以，为了完成这个比喻，我是一个天真的初创领导者，相信我可以在谷歌内部充分发挥 Waze 的潜力并征服这头野兽，不管它的性质如何。这种非理性的信念对于初创企业领导者来说至关重要，但在企业环境中却具有挑战性。

So what happened? I had all the independence I could ask for, no?

所以发生了什么事？我拥有我可以要求的所有独立性，不是吗？

**It's the nature of the beast.**

**这是野兽的本性。**

Working as an independent start-up is fundamentally different from a corporation and it is much more nuanced and deep than I had understood. I am proud of what we achieved within Google - when we started talking to Google, we had 10M MAU's vs 140M MAU's when I left. We went from 2.5B monthly driven Km's to over 36B. We launched a completely new product, Carpool, and went through all the pain of MVP, iterations, launch until achieving product market fit. So what was so different from being independent? 
作为一家独立的初创公司工作与一家公司有着根本的不同，它比我所理解的要微妙和深刻得多。我为我们在 Google 内部取得的成就感到自豪 - 当我们开始与 Google 交谈时，我们的 MAU 为 10M，而我离开时的 MAU 为 140M。我们从每月 2.5B 的驱动公里数增加到 36B 以上。我们推出了一个全新的产品 Carpool，并经历了 MVP、迭代、发布的所有痛苦，直到实现产品市场契合。那么与独立有什么不同呢？

%20Index%20US%202017.pdf) 收购后，在信任度和实用性方面不断被评为顶级 Alphabet 品牌之一。

**Brand** \- in a start-up there is complete alignment between the product, the company and the brand. The employees, management and investors are aligned as well - product does well, company does well, investors do well, employees do well. In a Corporation, the employee alignment is to the Corporations brand, not to the product (i.e. Google, not Gmail; Facebook, not Instagram). The product is a tool to advance the employees career, not a passion, mission or economic game changer. Being promoted has more impact on the individuals economic success than the product growth. The decision which product to work on stems from the odds of getting promoted and thus we began onboarding people with the wrong state of mind - seeing Waze as a stepping stone and not as a calling.

**品牌** \- 在初创企业中，产品、公司和品牌之间是完全一致的。员工、管理层和投资者也保持一致——产品做得好，公司做得好，投资者做得好，员工做得好。在公司中，员工的一致性是针对公司品牌，而不是针对产品（即 Google，而不是 Gmail；Facebook，而不是 Instagram）。该产品是促进员工职业发展的工具，而不是激情、使命或经济游戏规则的改变者。与产品增长相比，晋升对个人经济成功的影响更大。决定使用哪种产品取决于获得晋升的可能性，因此我们开始以错误的心态引导人们 - 将 Waze 视为垫脚石而不是召唤。

**Hiring, Firing and Promoting.** The famous [Netflix culture doc](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) claims that culture is “who you hire, fire or let go”. I strongly agree with this, reality > theory. The challenge was that, as Google employees, we were subject to all of the Corporate hiring practices. It is practically impossible to fire someone for the basic reason that you don't need this role any more or there is a better person out there or just plain old "you are not doing a great job". This neuters managers and does not lead to great teams, driven by mission, pushing each other to do better. Fast paced products have different needs that change all the time. There are people who are great for a stage of the company and later, do not have the right skills as the company grows. It is not their fault, it is reality. But not being able to replace them with people that do have the right skills means that people are constantly trying to “offload” an employee on a different team rather than fire them - something that is not conducive with fast moving and changing needs. I learned the hard way that if another manager is recommending a great employee to hire, that they are probably trying to get rid of the employee since they cannot fire them.

**招聘、解雇和晋升。**著名的 [Netflix 文化文档](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) 声称文化是“你雇用、解雇或放手的人”。我非常同意这一点，现实 > 理论。挑战在于，作为 Google 员工，我们必须遵守所有企业招聘惯例。解雇某人的基本原因几乎是不可能的，因为你不再需要这个角色，或者那里有更好的人，或者只是老套的“你做得不好”。这会使经理中性，并不会导致伟大的团队，在使命的驱动下，相互推动做得更好。快节奏的产品有不断变化的不同需求。有些人很适合公司的某个阶段，但随着公司的发展，他们没有合适的技能。这不是他们的错，这是现实。但是，无法用拥有合适技能的人来取代他们意味着人们不断试图将员工“卸载”到不同的团队中，而不是解雇他们——这不利于快速变化和不断变化的需求。我艰难地了解到，如果另一位经理推荐一位优秀的员工来聘用，他们可能会试图解雇该员工，因为他们无法解雇他们。

**Distribution** \- we quickly learned, the hard way, that we could not get distribution from Google. Any idea we had was quickly co-opted by Google Maps. The Android app store treated us as a 3rd party, there was no pre-installation option and no additional distribution. We did have a lot more marketing dollars to spend but had to spend them like any other company, except we were constrained in what we could do and which 3rd parties we could work with due to corporate policies. All of our growth at Waze post acquisition was from work we did, not support from the mothership. Looking back, we could have probably grown faster and much more efficiently had we stayed independent.

**分发** \- 我们很快就了解到，我们无法从 Google 获得分发。我们的任何想法都很快被谷歌地图采纳。 Android 应用商店将我们视为第 3 方，没有预安装选项，也没有额外分发。我们确实有更多的营销资金要花费，但不得不像其他任何公司一样花费它们，除了由于公司政策，我们在我们可以做什么以及我们可以与哪些第三方合作方面受到限制。我们在 Waze 收购后的所有成长都来自我们所做的工作，而不是来自母舰的支持。回顾过去，如果我们保持独立，我们可能会成长得更快、效率更高。

**Focus** \- as much as I tried to keep the team focused, being part of a Corporation means that the signal to noise ratio changes dramatically. The amount of time and effort spent on Legal, Policy, Privacy - on features that have not shipped to users yet, meant a significant waste of resources and focus. After the acquisition, we have an extremely long project that consumed many of our best engineers to align our data retention policies and tools to Google. I am not saying this is not important BUT this had zero value to our users. An ever increasing percent of our time went to non user value creation tasks and that changes the DNA of the company quickly, from customer focused to corporate guidelines focused. 
**专注** \- 尽管我试图让团队保持专注，但作为公司的一部分意味着信噪比会发生巨大变化。花费在法律、政策、隐私上的时间和精力——在尚未交付给用户的功能上，意味着资源和注意力的严重浪费。收购后，我们有一个非常长的项目，该项目消耗了我们许多最优秀的工程师来使我们的数据保留政策和工具与 Google 保持一致。我并不是说这不重要，但这对我们的用户来说价值为零。我们越来越多的时间用于非用户价值创造任务，这迅速改变了公司的 DNA，从以客户为中心到以企业准则为中心。
**Compensation** \- at Corp-Tech, the salaries are so high and the options so valuable that it creates many misalignments. The impact of an individual product on the Corp-Tech stock is minimal so equity is basically free money. Regardless of your performance (individually) or your product performance, you equity grows significantly so nothing you do has real economic impact on your family. The only control you have to increase your economic returns are whether you get promoted, since that drives your equity and salary payments. This breaks the traditional tech model of risk reward. Corp-Tech gives you no risk returns on equity. Since 2008, FAANG stock have only gone up so employees look at the equity is a fixed part of their salary with the only option of increasing. We tried to build an innovative compensation model but quickly ran into the challenge that employees viewed their equity as a given compensation so why sacrifice it for a risk model? These realities lead to extreme focus on promotion vs product success -- Me > We > Product/Users. I feel that the risk reward model in Corp-Tech is broken due to ever rising stock prices and lack of personal impact on your returns. Perhaps Corp-Tech should move to employee share buy back where employees must sacrifice some of their salary for equity or change equity to vest by a product related metric to connect the teams performance with the employee returns.

**薪酬** \- 在 Corp-Tech，薪水如此之高，而且选择如此宝贵，以至于造成了许多错位。单个产品对 Corp-Tech 股票的影响很小，因此股权基本上是免费资金。无论您的业绩（个人）或您的产品业绩如何，您的资产都会显着增长，因此您所做的任何事情都不会对您的家庭产生真正的经济影响。要增加经济回报，您唯一需要控制的是是否升职，因为这会影响您的股权和工资支付。这打破了传统的风险回报技术模型。 Corp-Tech 不会为您提供股权风险回报。自 2008 年以来，FAANG 股票一直在上涨，因此员工认为股权是他们工资的固定部分，唯一的选择是增加。我们试图建立一个创新的薪酬模型，但很快就遇到了挑战，即员工将他们的股权视为给定的薪酬，那么为什么要为风险模型牺牲它呢？这些现实导致极端关注促销与产品成功——我 > 我们 > 产品/用户。我觉得 Corp-Tech 的风险回报模型由于不断上涨的股票价格以及对您的回报缺乏个人影响而被打破。也许 Corp-Tech 应该转向员工股票回购，在这种情况下，员工必须牺牲部分薪水换取股权，或者通过产品相关指标更改股权以归属，以将团队绩效与员工回报联系起来。

**Transparency and directness** \- I have always been a pretty passionate guy, especially at Waze. After the acquisition, I was invited to speak on many different Google panels and events and very quickly, I began racking up my HR complaints. I used a four letter word, my analogy was not PC, my language was not PG… I actually stopped speaking at events where the majority appreciated what I was saying but the minority that was offended by something (words and not content) made it a pain. I began watching what I said, what I discussed and began wearing a corporate persona (I was still probably one of the less PC characters at Google but this was my cleaned up act…). I value transparency and feel that people should bring themselves to work but that also means a certain tolerance of people not saying something exactly as you would like them to or believing something you don't. That tolerance is gone at Google and “words” > “content” is the new Silicon Valley mantra of political correctness. You can say terrible things as long as your pronouns are correct or can say super important things but use one wrong word and it's off to HR for you…

**透明度和直接性** \- 我一直是一个非常热情的人，尤其是在位智。收购后，我被邀请在许多不同的 Google 小组和活动中发言，很快，我开始抱怨人力资源。我用了一个四字母的词，我的比喻不是 PC，我的语言不是 PG……我实际上在大多数人赞赏我所说的话的活动中停止发言，但少数人被某事（文字而不是内容）冒犯了疼痛。我开始观察我所说的，我讨论的，并开始穿着公司的角色（我可能仍然是谷歌较少的 PC 角色之一，但这是我清理的行为......）。我重视透明度，并认为人们应该让自己去工作，但这也意味着对人们不完全按照您希望他们说的话或相信您不相信的话有一定的容忍度。在谷歌，这种宽容已经消失，“文字”>“内容”是硅谷政治正确的新口头禅。只要您的代词是正确的，您就可以说糟糕的事情，或者可以说非常重要的事情但用了一个错误的词，HR 就会为您负责……

即使它影响了我们的工作。
**Work life balance.** When I was growing up in Tech in the ‘90’s - there was no such thing as work life balance. We loved what we did and wanted to succeed so we worked like crazy to achieve great things. As I had kids, I learned the importance of being at home for them and that's how I understood Work Life balance - its a balance, sometimes you need to work weekends and nights or travel, sometimes you can head out early or work from home - we balance the needs of the employee and the company. Today, in Silicon Valley, work life balance has become sacrificing Work for Life - not a balance. Young people want it all - they want to get promoted quickly, achieve economic independence, feel fulfilled at Work, be home early, not miss the Yoga class at 11:00am etc. Having trouble scheduling meetings because “it's the new Yoga instructor lesson I cannot miss” or “I'm taking a personal day” drove me crazy. The worst thing is that this was inline with the policies and norms - I was the weirdo who wanted to push things fast and expected some level of personal sacrifice when needed. I don't believe long hours are a badge of honor but I also believe that we have to do whatever it takes to win, even if its on a weekend.

**工作生活平衡。**当我在 90 年代在科技行业长大时 - 没有工作生活平衡这样的东西。我们热爱我们所做的并希望成功，所以我们疯狂地工作以取得伟大的成就。因为我有孩子，我了解了在家对他们的重要性，这就是我理解工作生活平衡的方式——它是一种平衡，有时你需要在周末和晚上工作或旅行，有时你可以早点出门或在家工作——我们平衡员工和公司的需求。今天，在硅谷，工作与生活的平衡已经成为牺牲生命的工作——而不是平衡。年轻人想要这一切——他们想要快速晋升、实现经济独立、在工作中感到满足、早点回家、不要错过上午 11:00 的瑜伽课等。安排会议时遇到麻烦，因为“这是我的新瑜伽教练课不能错过”或“我要度过一个私人的一天”让我发疯。最糟糕的是，这符合政策和规范——我是个怪人，想要快速推进事情并期望在需要时做出一定程度的个人牺牲。我不相信长时间工作是一种荣誉，但我也相信我们必须不惜一切代价赢得胜利，即使是在周末。

Sushi AGAIN?!?" while [50M Americans are food insecure](https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20USDA's%20latest,uncertain%20access%20to%20enough%20food. )

**Entitlement**\- everyone working in the tech space is SUPER LUCKY. If you happen to work for one of the tech corporations - you are even luckier. You get unbelievable conditions (food, gym, offsites, travel), amazing economic wealth creation, can work on amazing things surrounded by the best and the brightest. But many of the people I met did not understand or appreciate it. Tech workers leaving college directly to Corp-Tech and never working for a “real company” end up spending their time complaining about the wrong things. When COVID hit and we moved to work from home - a huge amount of complaints began around why can't employees expense food since they are not in the office. While most "real" people were worried about keeping their jobs or finding one, many employees were complaining about expensing their food on top of their salaries/stock/bonuses. This entitlement continued everywhere - while Google is BY FAR the most employee centric company giving tremendous hard and soft value to its employees, employees keep creating imaginary problems to complain about, instead of appreciating the hand they have been dealt. After being acquired by Google, we had a “fun day” at the Google campus where we were shown around, wide eyed, to see the facilities. We had lunch in the cafeteria and while on line, a Googler ahead of us was overheard saying “What? Sushi again???” which became our inside joke around entitlement. But several months later, we had been co-opted as well and it was Waze employees complaining about the food...

**权利**\- 在科技领域工作的每个人都很幸运。如果您碰巧为其中一家科技公司工作 - 您就更幸运了。你会得到令人难以置信的条件（食物、健身房、异地、旅行），创造惊人的经济财富，可以在最优秀和最聪明的人的包围下从事令人惊奇的事情。但我遇到的许多人并不理解或欣赏它。从大学毕业后直接进入 Corp-Tech 并且从未为“真正的公司”工作的技术人员最终会花时间抱怨错误的事情。当 COVID 来袭，我们开始在家工作时——大量的抱怨开始围绕着为什么员工不在办公室而不能支付食物费用。虽然大多数“真正的”人都担心保住工作或找到一份工作，但许多员工抱怨说，除了工资/股票/奖金之外，还要浪费食物。这种权利无处不在——虽然谷歌是迄今为止最以员工为中心的公司，它为员工提供了巨大的软硬件价值，但员工不断制造想象中的问题来抱怨，而不是感谢他们得到的帮助。被谷歌收购后，我们在谷歌园区度过了“有趣的一天”，我们被带到了周围，睁大眼睛，看看设施。我们在自助餐厅吃午饭，在线时，无意中听到我们前面的一位 Google 员工说：“什么？又是寿司？？？”这成了我们关于权利的内部笑话。但几个月后，我们也被增选了，是 Waze 员工抱怨食物......

All these issues drove me crazy. I believe in the Waze mission and love the company and wanted to continue to grow it. These aspects of corporate life slowly wore me down. at the end of every day, I always ask myself "what did I do for our users today". This simple exercise helps keep priorities straight. When I found myself avoiding this question because I was embarrassed by the answer, I knew my time was up.

所有这些问题都让我发疯。我相信 Waze 的使命，热爱这家公司，并希望继续发展它。公司生活的这些方面慢慢地让我感到厌烦。在每天结束时，我总是问自己“今天我为我们的用户做了什么”。这个简单的练习有助于保持优先顺序。当我发现自己因为对答案感到尴尬而回避这个问题时，我知道我的时间到了。

I feel we ended up with the worst of both worlds - the challenges of a start-up (scale, access, distribution) with the constraints of a corporation (forced to use internal not-best-of-class systems, cost structure, politics , culture etc) all aggravated by the inability to quickly hire and fire.

我觉得我们最终得到了两全其美的结果——初创公司的挑战（规模、访问、分销）与公司的限制（被迫使用内部非一流系统、成本结构、政治、文化等）都因无法快速招聘和解雇而恶化。

**So, what can be done?** 
**那么，可以做什么？**
I think that the independent model is a must for acquisitions. No one buys technology, you buy a team and a way of doing things. I think this has worked in most cases. That being said, how to retain the start-up magic is extremely difficult. I think that the Alphabet model is the correct model (at Google) but not as a “moonshot factory” but rather as a holding company. Amazon did this with Audible - keeping it an independent legal entity with its own culture and processes. Yes, there is a challenge of how to compensate when there is no equity upside but I think the main point is to keep the company focused on the product, with the right employees there for the right reasons and empowering the leader to control her destiny. One of the main challenges with this is that people who grow up in a Corporate environment do not really understand these issues since this is how things are done in Corp-Tech so it makes these issues hard to negotiate.

我认为独立模式是收购必须的。没有人买技术，你买的是一个团队和一种做事方式。我认为这在大多数情况下都有效。话虽如此，如何保留启动魔法是极其困难的。我认为 Alphabet 模型是正确的模型（在谷歌），但不是作为“登月工厂”，而是作为控股公司。亚马逊通过 Audible 做到了这一点——使其成为具有自己文化和流程的独立法人实体。是的，在没有股权上涨的情况下如何进行补偿是一个挑战，但我认为重点是让公司专注于产品，以正确的理由雇佣合适的员工，并授权领导者控制自己的命运。与此有关的主要挑战之一是，在企业环境中长大的人并不真正了解这些问题，因为这就是 Corp-Tech 的工作方式，因此使这些问题难以协商。

**What did I learn?**

**我学到了什么？**

**I am confident that the Waze acquisition was a success. The problem was me - believing I can keep the start-up magic within a corporation, in spite of all the evidence showing opposite.** Had I not set out to fight the nature of the beast, I could have focused on building for leaving rather than building for the users. 3 years ago I realized this and wanted to leave but the company was still too start-up'ish and dependent on me. I have spent the last 3 years building a new team and leadership that can carry on the mission without me, within the corporate constraints, to the point where I could leave.

**我相信 Waze 的收购是成功的。问题出在我身上——我相信我可以在公司内部保持启动魔法，尽管所有证据都显示相反。**如果我没有开始与野兽的本性作斗争，我本可以专注于建立离开而不是为用户构建。 3 年前，我意识到这一点并想离开，但公司仍然过于初创且依赖我。在过去的 3 年里，我一直在建立一个新的团队和领导层，在没有我的情况下，在公司的限制下，我可以继续完成使命，直到我可以离开。

I would recommend to the 2013 me to not try and innovate within but rather focus on exiting the company as fast as possible and building the right team/structure/succession plan to make it happen instead of fighting the nature of the beast. This is easy to say but extremely hard to do if you love your company and mission. When you decide to sell a company, you need to be honest with yourself that this is the end of your era, and not pretend that you will be able to continue to build the company but with a different shareholders. This will make the selling decision harder and looking back, would have forced us to be more honest about what selling means.

我建议 2013 年的我不要尝试在内部进行创新，而是专注于尽快退出公司并建立正确的团队/结构/继任计划以实现它，而不是与野兽的本性作斗争。这说起来容易，但如果你热爱你的公司和使命，就很难做到。当你决定出售一家公司时，你需要对自己诚实，这是你时代的终结，不要假装你将能够继续建立公司，但与不同的股东。这将使销售决策变得更加困难，回顾过去，会迫使我们更诚实地了解销售的含义。

**So, why did I leave?**

**那么，我为什么要离开？**

I did not leave in a confrontational disagreement (which is what anyone who knows me thought would happen, as I have a short fuse...) but rather was just worn down by the nature of the beast. I have only positive things to say about the Google leadership that gave me all the independence it could. **If I had to summarize it, I would say that the signal to noise ratio is what wore me down.** We start companies to build products that serve people, not to sit in meetings with lawyers. You need to be able to answer the "what have I done for our users today" question with "not much but I got promoted" and be happy with that answer to be successful in Corp-Tech. I guess that's just not me. As the tech regulation / anti trust heats up - the noise will continue to get louder than the signal. The innovation challenges at Corp-Tech will only get worse as the risk tolerance will go down. Soon, Lawyers > Builders and the builders will need to go elsewhere to start new companies.

我没有在对抗性的分歧中离开（这是任何认识我的人都认为会发生的事情，因为我有一个短的保险丝......）而是只是被野兽的本性所累。对于 Google 的领导层，我只能说一些积极的事情，因为它赋予了我所有可能的独立性。 **如果要我总结一下，我会说是信噪比让我筋疲力尽。** 我们创办公司是为了打造为人们服务的产品，而不是坐在与律师的会议上。您需要能够回答“我今天为我们的用户做了什么”的问题，“不多，但我得到了提升”，并且对这个答案感到满意才能在 Corp-Tech 中取得成功。我想那不是我。随着技术法规/反垄断的升温 - 噪音将继续变得比信号更响亮。随着风险承受能力的下降，Corp-Tech 的创新挑战只会变得更糟。很快，律师 > 建设者和建设者将需要去其他地方创办新公司。
