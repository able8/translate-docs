Summary.

概括。

APIs are building blocks for digital transformation, but determining which APIs to develop and what products and solutions they’ll enable requires a digital mindset. You don’t have to be a tech company to reap the benefits of APIs, and they would particularly benefit small to midsize companies that now struggle to reach digital audiences through saturated and tightly controlled ad networks and ecommerce markets. APIs would position them to more easily offer products and services through emerging platforms, unbundle and re-bundle their core competencies, and offload non-core competencies to third-party providers. Companies that have been most successful with APIs display common thinking patterns and practices, something the authors call the “ways of the API.” They present three of the most impactful of these patterns.

API 是数字化转型的基石，但确定要开发哪些 API 以及它们将启用哪些产品和解决方案需要数字思维。您不必成为一家科技公司即可获得 API 的好处，它们尤其会使现在难以通过饱和且严格控制的广告网络和电子商务市场接触数字受众的中小型公司受益。 API 将使他们能够更轻松地通过新兴平台提供产品和服务，拆分和重新捆绑他们的核心能力，并将非核心能力卸载给第三方提供商。在 API 方面最成功的公司展示了共同的思维模式和实践，作者称之为“API 方式”。他们展示了这些模式中最具影响力的三个。

Application programming interfaces — more commonly known as APIs — are at the heart of the most successful digital companies, powering everything from Amazon’s cloud business to Google ads to Facebook likes. APIs enable mobile experiences, connect companies on the web, and enable platform business models. The idea of an “ [API economy](https://apievangelist.com/2010/09/25/the-api-economy/),” in which APIs create new value for companies, is over a decade old, and many established enterprises correctly view APIs as a key to unlocking their digital transformations. But it’s not just the digital giants that can benefit from APIs.

应用程序编程接口——通常称为 API——是最成功的数字公司的核心，为从亚马逊的云业务到谷歌广告再到 Facebook 点赞的一切提供支持。 API 支持移动体验、连接网络上的公司并支持平台业务模型。 API 为公司创造新价值的“[API 经济](https://apievangelist.com/2010/09/25/the-api-economy/)”的想法已有十多年历史，许多老牌企业正确地将 API 视为开启数字化转型的关键。但不仅仅是数字巨头可以从 API 中受益。

While we're firmly living in the digital age, companies whose success predated the web [have struggled to adapt to the digital business paradigm](http://hbr.org/2019/03/digital-transformation-is-not-about-technology), a fact underlined by the urgent need for digital transformation brought about by the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/coronavirus-is-accelerating-digital-strategy-formulation). These companies were designed for pre-web business, and their leaders’ mental models exist within those structures. To digitally transform their businesses, leaders need to transform their own mindsets to lead digital organizations.

虽然我们坚定地生活在数字时代，但成功早于网络的公司[一直在努力适应数字业务范式](http://hbr.org/2019/03/digital-transformation-is-not-about -技术），Covid-19 大流行。这些公司是为前网络业务而设计的，他们的领导者的心智模型存在于这些结构中。为了实现业务数字化转型，领导者需要转变自己的思维方式来领导数字化组织。

Jeff Lawson, CEO and co-founder of Twilio, [recently wrote](http://hbr.org/2021/01/in-the-digital-economy-your-software-is-your-competitive-advantage) about the importance of embracing software delivery as a core competency for every business. This is certainly true, but at the same time, it won’t be enough for, say, a logistics company to start shipping code instead of shipping freight. Leaders need to learn how to build digital solutions, but more importantly, they need to ensure they’re building the right ones.

Twilio 的首席执行官兼联合创始人 Jeff Lawson [最近写道](http://hbr.org/2021/01/in-the-digital-economy-your-software-is-your-competitive-advantage)将软件交付作为每个企业的核心竞争力的重要性。这当然是正确的，但同时，对于物流公司来说，开始运输代码而不是运输货物是不够的。领导者需要学习如何构建数字解决方案，但更重要的是，他们需要确保构建正确的解决方案。

Twilio itself presents an interesting case. Born in the wake of Apple’s iPhone and App Store launches, they struck digital gold by focusing on a very specific need: App developers’ need to take advantage of a smartphone’s carrier services like voice, text, and billing. They've since achieved [unicorn status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies), gone public, and even recently made a $3.2 billion [acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/). The core products that met this demand and fueled this growth were web APIs.

Twilio 本身提供了一个有趣的案例。在 Apple 推出 iPhone 和 App Store 之后，他们通过专注于一个非常具体的需求而获得了数字黄金：应用程序开发人员需要利用智能手机的运营商服务，如语音、文本和计费。从那以后，他们获得了 [独角兽地位](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies)，上市，甚至最近还获得了 32 亿美元的 [收购](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-an-stock-deal/)。满足这种需求并推动这种增长的核心产品是 Web API。

You don’t have to be a tech company to reap the benefits of APIs — the opportunity exists in every industry. Some sectors are being compelled to offer APIs due to regulation (like healthcare and banking), whereas others are prompted by industry interoperability (like telecommunications) or disruption (like retail, media, and entertainment). 

您不必成为一家科技公司即可获得 API 的好处——每个行业都存在机会。由于监管（如医疗保健和银行业），一些行业被迫提供 API，而其他行业则是由行业互操作性（如电信）或中断（如零售、媒体和娱乐）推动的。

A transformation toward APIs would particularly benefit small to midsize companies that now struggle to reach digital audiences through saturated and tightly controlled ad networks and ecommerce markets. APIs would position them to more easily offer products and services through emerging platforms, unbundle and re-bundle their core competencies, and offload non-core competencies to third-party providers (like Lyft's use of Google Maps, Stripe, Twilio, and Amazon Web Services).

向 API 转型将特别有利于中小型公司，这些公司现在正努力通过饱和且严格控制的广告网络和电子商务市场接触数字受众。 API 将使他们能够更轻松地通过新兴平台提供产品和服务，拆分和重新捆绑他们的核心能力，并将非核心能力卸载给第三方提供商（例如 Lyft 使用 Google Maps、Stripe、Twilio 和 Amazon Web服务）。

Any business with a website or mobile app already has much of what’s needed to offer APIs, but it’s not enough to arbitrarily open up APIs to the web. Companies that have been most successful with APIs display common thinking patterns and practices, something we call the “ways of the API.” Following are three of the most impactful of these patterns.

任何拥有网站或移动应用程序的企业已经拥有提供 API 所需的大部分内容，但仅仅向网络开放 API 是不够的。在 API 方面最成功的公司展示了共同的思维模式和实践，我们称之为“API 方式”。以下是这些模式中最具影响力的三个。

## The Unbundling Way: Dismantling and Rebuilding Business Capabilities Through APIs

## 拆分方式：通过 API 分解和重建业务能力

Jeff Bezos published a [corporate edict](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611) around 2002 mandating that from that point forward, all product teams were required to expose their data and functionality through APIs. Not only that, he insisted that teams were _only_ allowed to communicate with each other through these APIs. It was an extreme step intended to promote team autonomy and product agility. It was a few years before the mandate took hold, but it created an unprecedented platform for growth. As a result of the mandate, Amazon decomposed its internal infrastructure-provisioning services through web-friendly interfaces and was able to launch what is now its most profitable business unit: AWS.

Jeff Bezos 在 2002 年左右发布了[公司法令](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)，要求从那时起，所有产品团队都必须通过 API 公开他们的数据和功能。不仅如此，他还坚持_只_允许团队通过这些 API 相互通信。这是旨在促进团队自治和产品敏捷性的极端步骤。几年前，这项任务才生效，但它创造了一个前所未有的增长平台。作为授权的结果，亚马逊通过网络友好的界面分解了其内部基础设施配置服务，并能够推出现在最赚钱的业务部门：AWS。

[Unbundling software functionality](http://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling) into API-accessible business capabilities is a hallmark of leading digital companies. They then re-bundle these capabilities to extend their reach or open up new customer segments. APIs helped Netflix achieve screen ubiquity and accelerated Uber’s move into food delivery. But non-tech companies wanting to move at the pace of digital business also need to follow the “unbundling way of the API.” For example, when the pandemic hit Australia, New South Wales Health Pathology was able to [stand up testing infrastructure within two weeks](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-apis-helped-nsw-health-pathology-respond-to-covid-19-549796) to support hundreds of thousands of tests and communicate their results thanks in large part to their already unbundled, API-enabled software services.

[将软件功能分拆](http://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling) 转化为 API 可访问的业务能力是领先数字公司的标志。然后，他们重新捆绑这些功能，以扩大其影响范围或开辟新的客户群。 API 帮助 Netflix 实现了屏幕无处不在，并加速了 Uber 进军外卖领域。但想要跟上数字业务步伐的非技术公司也需要遵循“API 的分拆方式”。例如，当大流行袭击澳大利亚时，新南威尔士州卫生病理学能够[在两周内建立测试基础设施](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-apis-helped-nsw-health-pathology-respond-to-covid-19-549796) 来支持数十万个测试并传达他们的结果，这在很大程度上要归功于他们已经分拆的、支持 API 的软件服务。

## The Outside-In Way: Designing and Developing with the API Consumers in Mind

## 由外而内的方式：设计和开发时考虑到 API 消费者

Stripe entered a crowded payments market in 2010. Identifying mobile app developers as an underserved customer segment, Stripe focused on delivering the most useful and usable APIs possible. It worked. Stripe has close to 20% of the online payments [market share](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payment-processing--26) (a number that's growing), and the company is valued at over [$100 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/02/17/investors-are-now-valuing-stripe-at-115-billion/?sh=6e5cea344786). One of the pillars of their success has been an unwavering commitment to designing their products outside-in from the consumer’s perspective. In other words, they put themselves in their consumers’ (in this case, the developers’) shoes, then created intuitive, efficient interfaces for developers building apps that use the API, and provided documentation and tools to support them. 

Stripe 于 2010 年进入了一个拥挤的支付市场。Stripe 将移动应用程序开发人员确定为服务不足的客户群，因此专注于提供尽可能最有用和可用的 API。有效。 Stripe 拥有接近 20% 的在线支付 [市场份额](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payment-processing--26)（这个数字还在增长），公司估值超过[1000亿美元](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/02/17/investors-are-now-valueing-stripe-at-115-billion/?sh=6e5cea344786)。他们成功的支柱之一是坚定不移地致力于从消费者的角度由外而内设计他们的产品。换句话说，他们将自己置于消费者（在本例中为开发人员)的角度，然后为开发人员构建使用 API 的应用程序创建直观、高效的界面，并提供文档和工具来支持他们。

Many fast-growing companies can overload their consumers with too many product features as they bring new ones to the market. Stripe has avoided this problem by continually evolving its API products to [streamline the developer experience](https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design). This “ [jobs-to-be-done](http://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)” thinking is another important characteristic of how successful digital companies use APIs. A non-tech company that applied this approach is Pilot Flying J, a North American truck stop chain. By digitizing capabilities such as [shower reservations](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/api-first-strategy-and-mulesoft-help-pilot-flying-j-break-down-data-silos/), parking availability, and prepaid fueling through APIs, they allowed mobile app developers to quickly and conveniently package these services for their customers — truck drivers. To build loyalty with the developers who will build the applications that provide the digital touchpoints for their customers, companies must follow this “outside-in way of the API.”

许多快速发展的公司在向市场推出新产品时，可能会为消费者提供过多的产品功能。 Stripe 通过不断改进其 API 产品以[简化开发人员体验](https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design)避免了这个问题。这种“[jobs-to-be-done](http://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)”的想法是成功的数字公司如何使用的另一个重要特征蜜蜂。应用这种方法的非技术公司是 Pilot Flying J，这是一家北美卡车停靠链。通过数字化功能，例如 [淋浴预订](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/api-first-strategy-and-mulesoft-help-pilot-flying-j-break-down-data-silos/)，停车位，以及通过 API 预付费加油，它们使移动应用程序开发人员能够快速方便地为他们的客户（卡车司机)打包这些服务。为了与将为客户提供数字接触点的应用程序的开发人员建立忠诚度，公司必须遵循这种“由外而内的 API 方式”。

## The Ecosystem Way: Cultivating a Digital Ecosystem with APIs

## 生态系统方式：使用 API 培育数字生态系统

Twilio invented a new business model for the app economy. Recognizing that app developers would want low-friction services and global coverage, Twilio became a retailer for the carriers’ wholesale APIs. Where did that recognition come from?

Twilio 为应用经济发明了一种新的商业模式。认识到应用程序开发人员需要低摩擦服务和全球覆盖，Twilio 成为运营商批发 API 的零售商。这种认可从何而来？

Borrowing another Clayton Christensen concept, Twilio envisioned the “value network” for mobile applications, the digital ecosystem within which apps would exist. By looking at the various stakeholders (app users, app developers, third-party service providers) and the value exchanges between them, Twilio identified a gap that could be filled — combining and accelerating carrier services — to the benefit of all ecosystem members. Twilio helped put useful services in apps for app users, sped up delivery time for developers, and drove higher consumption for carrier services.

借用 Clayton Christensen 的另一个概念，Twilio 设想了移动应用程序的“价值网络”，应用程序将在其中存在的数字生态系统。通过查看各种利益相关者（应用程序用户、应用程序开发人员、第三方服务提供商）以及他们之间的价值交换，Twilio 确定了一个可以填补的空白 - 合并和加速运营商服务 - 以造福所有生态系统成员。 Twilio 帮助应用程序用户将有用的服务放入应用程序中，加快了开发人员的交付时间，并推动了运营商服务的更高消费。

Digital innovators use ecosystem thinking to chart strategies for sustainable growth and use APIs as conduits for value exchange within the value network. Companies that want to stay adaptable enough to survive and thrive in the digital economy should embrace this “ecosystem way of the API.” For example, Airbus recognized an issue in the aviation industry where critical flight and operational data was locked away in siloes. Being a supplier to most airlines and thus having strong relationships across the ecosystem, Airbus [launched an API-enabled data platform called Skywise](https://skywise.airbus.com/) to help the airlines reduce maintenance issues and prevent technical delays .

数字创新者使用生态系统思维来制定可持续增长战略，并使用 API 作为价值网络内价值交换的渠道。希望保持足够的适应性以在数字经济中生存和繁荣的公司应该接受这种“API 的生态系统方式”。例如，空中客车公司认识到航空业的一个问题，即关键的飞行和运营数据被锁在孤岛中。作为大多数航空公司的供应商，因此在整个生态系统中拥有牢固的关系，空中客车 [推出了一个名为 Skywise 的支持 API 的数据平台](https://skywise.airbus.com/) 以帮助航空公司减少维护问题并防止技术延误.

## A Heavy Lift, but Not Necessarily a Costly One

## 一个沉重的电梯，但不一定是一个昂贵的电梯

A mental model is one of the hardest things for a leader to change, but it doesn’t have to be the most expensive. IDC projects that organizations will spend [$6.8 trillion on digital transformation between 2020 and 2023](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prMETA47037520). Large enterprises funding transformational programs can align their already budgeted spending with these new approaches.

心智模型是领导者最难改变的事情之一，但它不一定是最昂贵的。 IDC 预计，组织将在 [2020 年至 2023 年之间花费 6.8 万亿美元用于数字化转型](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prMETA47037520)。为转型计划提供资金的大型企业可以将其已经预算的支出与这些新方法保持一致。

Companies in industries where API-related regulations and standards are being implemented (PSD2 in financial services, FHIR in healthcare, TM Forum Open APIs in telecommunications) can use their compliance initiatives to strategic advantage. Smaller companies, whose customer and product focus is more specialized, could have an agility advantage in unbundling their capabilities, designing for their consumers, and exploiting opportunities in their respective ecosystems. The beauty of working with digital building blocks is that you don’t have to demolish the old factory and build a new one. 

正在实施 API 相关法规和标准的行业（金融服务领域的 PSD2、医疗保健领域的 FHIR、电信领域的 TM 论坛开放 API）中的公司可以利用其合规性举措获得战略优势。较小的公司，其客户和产品的重点更加专业化，可以在拆分能力、为消费者设计和利用各自生态系统中的机会方面具有敏捷优势。使用数字积木的美妙之处在于您不必拆除旧工厂并建造新工厂。

The best way to get started with APIs and API thinking is to start small and iterate. Form a small, cross-functional team of business and technology experts. Use the outside-in way to analyze customer experiences and identify digital opportunities. Use the ecosystem way to define target business models and external dependencies. Finally, use the unbundling way to define the API-enabled capabilities and infrastructure required to deliver innovative solutions. Measure, apply learning, and repeat. This approach can allow the organization to innovate with low risk and low net cost. The seed investment required would be funding for the team, plus money for API-specific infrastructure. This could likely be found in existing digital transformation budgets. Spending can scale up in alignment with delivered business value, protecting the organization from making too big of a bet too soon.

开始使用 API 和 API 思维的最佳方法是从小处着手并进行迭代。组建一个由业务和技术专家组成的小型跨职能团队。使用由外而内的方式来分析客户体验并识别数字机会。使用生态系统方式定义目标业务模型和外部依赖。最后，使用分拆方式来定义交付创新解决方案所需的支持 API 的功能和基础设施。测量、应用学习并重复。这种方法可以让组织以低风险和低净成本进行创新。所需的种子投资将是团队的资金，以及特定于 API 的基础设施的资金。这可能会在现有的数字化转型预算中找到。支出可以与交付的业务价值保持一致，从而保护组织不会过早下太大的赌注。

A lot of work is required to naturalize an established company for the digital economy. But all that work will be in vain if the thinking doesn’t change first. APIs are building blocks for digital transformation, but determining which APIs to develop and what products and solutions they’ll enable requires a digital mindset. Digital pioneers have created a template for success. Adherent organizations must pay attention to the how and why in addition to the what. 

要将一家成熟的公司归化为数字经济，需要做大量工作。但如果思想不先改变，所有这些工作都将是徒劳的。 API 是数字化转型的基石，但确定要开发哪些 API 以及它们将启用哪些产品和解决方案需要数字思维。数字先驱创造了成功的模板。除了什么之外，附属组织还必须注意如何和为什么。
