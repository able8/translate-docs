# DevOps 文化：关于你的 5 个问题

Is your team is creating a DevOps culture that can last – or one that is destined for failure? These questions can be illuminating

您的团队正在创建一种可以持续的 DevOps 文化，还是一种注定会失败的文化？这些问题可能很有启发性

At its core, [DevOps](https://enterprisersproject.com/tags/devops) is a marriage between culture and [automation](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/66) tools, helping teams release better software more quickly. While there are plenty of innovative tools fueling DevOps, those tools mean little if the culture doesn’t support the objectives of the team.

[DevOps](https://enterprisersproject.com/tags/devops) 的核心是文化与 [自动化](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/66) 工具的结合，帮助团队更好地发布软件更快。虽然有很多创新工具推动了 DevOps，但如果文化不支持团队的目标，这些工具就毫无意义。

When evaluating your DevOps culture, it’s important to take an honest look at your team to gauge the health of your culture and identify areas where it can improve. Ask yourself these questions to see if your team is creating a culture that can last – or brewing one that is destined for failure.

在评估您的 DevOps 文化时，重要的是要诚实地审视您的团队，以衡量您文化的健康状况并确定可以改进的领域。问自己这些问题，看看你的团队是否正在创造一种可以持久的文化——或者正在酝酿一种注定失败的文化。

## 1\. Do team members respect one another?

## 1\.团队成员互相尊重吗？

It’s nearly impossible to build a healthy culture when team members don’t respect one another. A lack of respect is easy to spot. Do team members hold back their opinions because they are fearful of being belittled by others or know their ideas won’t be taken seriously?

当团队成员不相互尊重时，几乎不可能建立一种健康的文化。缺乏尊重很容易被发现。团队成员是否因为害怕被他人贬低或知道他们的想法不会被认真对待而保留自己的意见？

This suppression of ideas hurts the team and creates a toxic culture where people don’t feel their opinion is valued. A survey by [TinyPulse](https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/13-surprising-statistics-about-employee-retention) found that 26 percent of employees said they were more likely to leave their job if they feel disrespected by their colleagues.

这种对想法的压制伤害了团队，并创造了一种有毒的文化，让人们觉得他们的意见不被重视。 [TinyPulse](https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/13-surprising-statistics-about-employee-retention) 的一项调查发现，26% 的员工表示，如果他们感到不受尊重，他们更有可能离职由他们的同事。

When the DevOps team learns to value each other’s input, buy-in and ownership grow.

当 DevOps 团队学会重视彼此的投入时，支持和所有权就会增加。

Team members should be encouraged to speak freely. Everyone should have the opportunity to voice their opinion, and the team shouldn’t take a judgemental stance on anyone’s viewpoint. Ideas should be discussed on their merits. When the team learns to value each other’s input, the buy-in and ownership grow as each member sees their unique contribution to the whole. Any team member who can’t respect others may have to be given a new role outside of the team. No one person’s value is significant enough to justify serving as a roadblock to the team’s success.

应鼓励团队成员畅所欲言。每个人都应该有机会表达自己的意见，团队不应该对任何人的观点采取评判性的立场。应该讨论想法的优点。当团队学会重视彼此的投入时，随着每个成员看到他们对整体的独特贡献，认同感和所有权都会增加。任何不能尊重他人的团队成员都可能不得不在团队之外被赋予新的角色。没有人的价值足以证明其成为团队成功的障碍。

## 2\. Are you fostering a culture of trust?

## 2\.你在培养信任文化吗？

The dynamic of trust in DevOps teams exists between employees and their managers as well as between co-workers. No one is an island on a DevOps team. Co-workers must rely on one another to do their jobs effectively. If a member sets unrealistic estimates or doesn’t pull their weight, it can weaken the efforts of the entire team. Employees must work to establish that trust with their team members.

DevOps 团队中的信任动态存在于员工和他们的经理以及同事之间。在 DevOps 团队中，没有人是孤岛。同事们必须相互依赖才能有效地完成工作。如果一个成员设定了不切实际的估计或不加强他们的权重，它会削弱整个团队的努力。员工必须努力与团队成员建立这种信任。

Equally important is the team’s trust in management. In the same TinyPulse survey, 61 percent of employees reported trust in senior management as key to their job satisfaction. From the C-level down, management should actively take part in the DevOps journey, supporting their teams every step of the way. Management should help provide the vision that fuels the team’s goals and avoid the temptation of derailing them by shifting priorities mid-sprint.

同样重要的是团队对管理层的信任。在同一项 TinyPulse 调查中，61% 的员工表示对高级管理层的信任是他们工作满意度的关键。从 C 级开始，管理层应该积极参与 DevOps 之旅，在每一步都支持他们的团队。管理层应该帮助提供推动团队目标的愿景，并避免通过在 sprint 中期改变优先级而使目标脱轨的诱惑。

Team members need to know the value they add to the organization is being seen by management.

团队成员需要知道他们为组织增加的价值正在被管理层看到。

## 3\. Is everyone in the team involved in scrum?

## 3. 团队中的每个人都参与了 Scrum 吗？

From QA to operations, aim to have the whole DevOps team participate. 

从 QA 到运营，旨在让整个 DevOps 团队参与。

DevOps pulls in members from different departments throughout the organization in order to work towards a common goal of delivering a great product. Some teams constrain the conversation when it comes to daily [scrum](https://opensource.com/resources/scrum?intcmp=701f2000000tjyaAAA) meetings. If the developers only meet with the project managers to map out their day, you lose the input of key stakeholders, and things will inevitably slip through the cracks.

DevOps 吸引来自整个组织不同部门的成员，以实现交付出色产品的共同目标。当涉及到每日 [scrum](https://opensource.com/resources/scrum?intcmp=701f2000000tjyaAAA) 会议时，一些团队会限制对话。如果开发人员只是与项目经理会面来规划他们的一天，那么你就会失去关键利益相关者的投入，事情将不可避免地从裂缝中溜走。

From QA to operations, aim to have the whole DevOps team participate in the conversation. This allows everyone from the team to have input. Misunderstood requirements are clarified. Potential blockers are flagged so the team can work to remove impediments.

从 QA 到运营，旨在让整个 DevOps 团队参与对话。这允许团队中的每个人都有意见。被误解的要求得到澄清。标记潜在的障碍物，以便团队可以努力消除障碍。

Regularly introducing this fresh perspective from other departments helps the team think about the project holistically instead of being isolated within their own silo.

定期从其他部门引入这种新观点有助于团队从整体上考虑项目，而不是被孤立在自己的孤岛中。

## 4\. Is the team co-located?

## 4. 团队是否在同一地点？

In an ideal world, the whole scrum team is occupying the same space. The same space doesn’t just mean they work in the same building or are spread across separate floors or departmental cubicle farms. The same space means the team is within arm’s reach of one another.

在理想的世界中，整个 Scrum 团队都占据着相同的空间。相同的空间不仅仅意味着他们在同一栋建筑中工作，或者分布在不同的楼层或部门隔间农场。相同的空间意味着团队在彼此的手臂范围内。

Being co-located allows the team to easily call an impromptu meeting to discuss a problem that has arisen. It allows select members of the team to quickly break off to whiteboard a solution for a feature that is failing to gel. In addition to removing blockers in real time, working in a dynamic environment like this builds bonds between employees that can be difficult to replicate when the team is [working remotely](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/12/remote-teams-5-culture-tips) or simply spread across different cities, buildings, or floors within the organization.

位于同一地点允许团队轻松召开临时会议来讨论出现的问题。它允许团队中的选定成员快速中断，为无法凝胶化的功能制定解决方案。除了实时消除阻碍之外，在这样的动态环境中工作还能建立员工之间的纽带，当团队[远程工作]时，这种纽带很难复制(https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/12/remote -teams-5-culture-tips）或简单地分布在组织内的不同城市、建筑物或楼层。

However, remote teams have become more common for a variety of reasons, and you can build culture on a dispersed team: Consider these 5 [tips for strengthening culture on remote teams](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/12 /remote-teams-5-culture-tips "Remote teams: 5 ways to build culture ").

但是，由于各种原因，远程团队变得越来越普遍，您可以在分散的团队中建立文化：考虑以下 5 个[加强远程团队文化的技巧](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/12 /remote-teams-5-culture-tips“远程团队：建立文化的 5 种方法”)。

## 5\. Does the team share in success?

## 5. 团队是否分享成功？

Most managers assume their teams are working towards a common set of goals. But if you actually take the time to ask each individual on the team what that objective is, their answers might surprise you.

大多数经理认为他们的团队正在朝着一组共同的目标努力。但如果你真的花时间问团队中的每个人这个目标是什么，他们的回答可能会让你大吃一惊。

It’s essential that each team member is focusing their efforts on the same end goal. These are [set DevOps goals that are measurable](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/7/devops-metrics-are-you-measuring-what-matters "DevOps metrics: Are you measuring what matters?") , and each should have a number attached.

每个团队成员都必须将精力集中在同一个最终目标上，这一点至关重要。这些是 [设定可衡量的 DevOps 目标](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/7/devops-metrics-are-you-measuring-what-matters “DevOps 指标：您是否在衡量重要的事情？”) ，并且每个都应该附有一个数字。

Maybe you want to meet an 80 percent satisfaction rate by your user community.

也许您希望用户社区达到 80% 的满意率。

Maybe you want to meet an 80 percent satisfaction rate by your user community. Perhaps you want to decrease the reported bug count in your releases by 10 percent. When you are working against hard numbers, it’s easy to judge success or failure. The team should have rewards tied to these goals, whether it's bonuses or an afternoon at the local go-kart track. The key is every member should be working in sync and trying to help the team achieve the common goal.

也许您希望用户社区达到 80% 的满意率。也许您希望将发布中报告的错误数量减少 10%。当您针对硬数字工作时，很容易判断成功或失败。团队应该获得与这些目标相关的奖励，无论是奖金还是在当地卡丁车赛道上度过的一个下午。关键是每个成员都应该同步工作并努力帮助团队实现共同目标。
