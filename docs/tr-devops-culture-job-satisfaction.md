Early analysis performed by [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/devops)  found that job satisfaction is a predictor of organizational performance. Having engaged employees doing meaningful work drives business value.

[DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/devops) 进行的早期分析发现，工作满意度是组织绩效的预测指标。让员工参与到有意义的工作中来推动业务价值。

Everybody knows how job satisfaction feels. It's about doing work that's challenging and meaningful, and being empowered to exercise skills and judgment. Where there's job satisfaction, employees bring the best of themselves to work: their engagement, their creativity, and their strongest thinking. The result is more innovation in any area of the business, including technology.

每个人都知道工作满意度的感觉。这是关于做具有挑战性和意义的工作，并被赋予锻炼技能和判断力的能力。哪里有工作满意度，员工就会把最好的自己带到工作中：他们的敬业度、创造力和最强大的思维。结果是在包括技术在内的任何业务领域都有更多的创新。

There's a virtuous circle when it comes to the benefits of job satisfaction. People do better work when they feel supported by their employers, when they have the tools and resources to do their work, and when they feel their judgment is valued. Better work results in higher software delivery performance, which results in higher organizational performance.

当谈到工作满意度的好处时，这是一个良性循环。当人们感到得到雇主的支持时，当他们拥有工作的工具和资源时，当他们觉得自己的判断受到重视时，他们会做得更好。更好的工作会带来更高的软件交付绩效，从而带来更高的组织绩效。

This cycle of continuous improvement and learning is what sets successful companies apart, enabling them to innovate, get ahead of the competition, and win.

这种持续改进和学习的循环使成功的公司与众不同，使他们能够创新、在竞争中领先并赢得胜利。

## Common pitfalls in job satisfaction

## 工作满意度的常见陷阱

The following pitfalls are commonly related to job satisfaction:

- Not giving people the [tools](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-teams-empowered-to-choose-tools)  they need to be successful.
- Not giving people meaningful work.

以下陷阱通常与工作满意度有关：

- 不给人们成功所需的 [工具](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-teams-empowered-to-choose-tools)。
- 不给人们有意义的工作。

Practitioners and leaders must remember that technology transformations are hard and take time, and often require an update in both technology and skill sets. Technology transformations also commonly require organizational changes like reorganizations and culture shifts, which can be difficult for people to navigate. If you're trying to institute change, don't forget that you must make time and resources available for improvement work. Creating change takes time, and people also need time to adjust to the changes, as you build practices such as [automation](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation)  and [ continuous integration](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-integration)  into your [delivery process](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-deployment-automation). On top of that, improving process is itself a skill that needs to be learned. Teams that routinely work on improvement get better at it over time, and are more likely to stay with the company.

从业者和领导者必须记住，技术转型是艰难的，需要时间，而且通常需要更新技术和技能组合。技术转型通常还需要组织变革，如重组和文化转变，这对人们来说可能很难驾驭。如果您正在尝试进行更改，请不要忘记您必须为改进工作腾出时间和资源。创造变化需要时间，人们也需要时间来适应变化，因为您构建了 [automation](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation) 和 [持续集成](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-integration) 到您的 [交付流程](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-部署自动化)。最重要的是，改进流程本身就是一项需要学习的技能。随着时间的推移，经常致力于改进的团队会变得更好，并且更有可能留在公司。

## Ways to improve job satisfaction

## 提高工作满意度的方法

DORA research on job satisfaction recommends the following key actions:

DORA 对工作满意度的研究建议采取以下关键行动：

- **Give employees the tools and resources needed to do their work.**

- **为员工提供完成工作所需的工具和资源。**

   Employees must have the tools necessary to get their work done, and [teams that can decide which tools they use](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-teams-empowered-to-choose-tools)  do better at continuous delivery. Teams that can choose their own tools make these choices based on how they work, and on the tasks they need to perform. No one knows better than practitioners what they need to be effective, so it's not surprising that practitioner tool choice helps to drive better outcomes.

    员工必须拥有完成工作所需的工具，并且[团队可以决定他们使用哪些工具](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-teams-empowered-to-choose-工具)在持续交付方面做得更好。可以选择自己的工具的团队会根据他们的工作方式以及他们需要执行的任务来做出这些选择。没有人比从业者更了解他们需要什么才能有效，因此从业者工具的选择有助于推动更好的结果也就不足为奇了。

   Employees must also have the resources necessary to do their work. Those might be technical resources, such as access to servers or environments necessary to develop and test, or resources needed to learn and develop new skills, such as access to course materials and budget to attend trainings or technical conferences.

员工还必须拥有完成工作所需的资源。这些可能是技术资源，例如访问开发和测试所需的服务器或环境，或学习和发展新技能所需的资源，例如访问课程材料和参加培训或技术会议的预算。

- **Give employees meaningful work that leverages their expertise.**

- **利用他们的专业知识为员工提供有意义的工作。**

   The importance of meaningful work can't be overstated. In some studies, employees have rated the importance of meaningful work just as highly as the importance of salary. Meaningful work makes a difference and is often very personal.

有意义的工作的重要性怎么强调都不为过。在一些研究中，员工对有意义工作的重要性与薪水的重要性一样高。有意义的工作会有所作为，而且通常非常个人化。

## Ways to measure job satisfaction 

## 衡量工作满意度的方法

Measuring job satisfaction in systems is hard. There just isn't a good way to proxy job satisfaction in system data. Much like organizational culture, job satisfaction is a perceptual measure, so to measure it, you must ask people for their opinions. If you worry that you won't get accurate answers, that's a signal that something is wrong and it's worth looking into. 

在系统中衡量工作满意度是困难的。只是没有一种很好的方法来代表系统数据中的工作满意度。就像组织文化一样，工作满意度是一种感性的衡量标准，所以要衡量它，你必须征求人们的意见。如果您担心自己不会得到准确的答案，这表明有问题，值得调查。
