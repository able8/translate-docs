# DevOps 文化：学习文化

Research from the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2014.pdf)  (PDF) team shows that an organizational culture that values learning contributes to software delivery performance with the following:

[DevOps 研究与评估 (DORA)](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2014.pdf)(PDF) 团队的研究表明，重视学习有助于提高软件交付性能：

- Increased deployment frequency
- Reduced lead time for changes, time to restore service, and change failure rate
- Strong team culture

- 增加部署频率
- 缩短变更的前置时间、恢复服务的时间和变更失败率
- 强大的团队文化

The climate for learning in your organization is directly related to the extent to which your organization treats learning as strategic:

贵组织的学习氛围与贵组织将学习视为战略的程度直接相关：

- Does your organization view learning as an investment necessary for growth?
- Is learning seen as a necessary burden, undertaken only grudgingly?
- Is learning completely avoided?

- 您的组织是否将学习视为增长所必需的投资？
- 学习是否被视为一种必要的负担，只是勉强进行？
- 是否完全避免学习？

Research done in other areas, such as accounting, has also shown that a climate for learning is predictive of performance gains.

在其他领域（例如会计）进行的研究也表明，学习氛围可以预测绩效提升。

## How to implement a learning culture

## 如何实施学习文化

You can help your organization create a climate for learning by viewing learning as the key to improvement and as an investment. Some steps you can take to directly support learning include:

通过将学习视为改进的关键和投资，您可以帮助您的组织营造学习氛围。您可以采取的一些直接支持学习的步骤包括：

- **Create a training budget, and advocate for it internally.** Emphasize how much the organization values a climate of learning by putting resources behind formal education opportunities.
- **Ensure that your team has the resources to engage in informal learning and the space to explore ideas.** Learning often happens outside of formal education. Some companies, like 3M and Google, set aside a portion of time for focused free-thinking and exploration of side projects.
- **Make it safe to fail.** If failure is punished, people won't try new things. Treat failures as opportunities to learn, and hold blameless post-mortems to work out how to improve processes and systems. Help people feel comfortable taking reasonable risks, and create a culture of innovation.
- **Create opportunities and spaces to share information.** Whether you hold weekly lightning talks or offer resources for monthly lunch-and-learns, set up a regular cadence of opportunities for employees to share their knowledge.
- **Make resources available for continued education.** For example, attending conferences is important for both exposure to new technology and case studies, as well as networking with peers.

- **制定培训预算，并在内部倡导。**通过将资源置于正规教育机会之后，强调组织对学习氛围的重视程度。
- **确保您的团队拥有参与非正式学习的资源和探索想法的空间。** 学习通常发生在正规教育之外。一些公司，如 3M 和谷歌，留出一部分时间专注于自由思考和探索副项目。
- **让失败变得安全。**如果失败受到惩罚，人们就不会尝试新事物。将失败视为学习的机会，并进行无可指责的事后分析，以找出如何改进流程和系统。帮助人们乐于承担合理的风险，并营造一种创新文化。
- **创造机会和空间来分享信息。** 无论您是每周举行一次闪电讲座，还是为每月的午餐和学习提供资源，都要为员工建立定期的机会来分享他们的知识。
- **为继续教育提供资源。**例如，参加会议对于接触新技术和案例研究以及与同行建立联系都很重要。

## Ways to improve your learning culture

## 改善学习文化的方法

Continuing to build a climate for learning is directly related to how an organization encourages and invests in learning. Here are some ways an organization can show that learning is important and necessary for growth:

继续营造学习氛围与组织如何鼓励和投资学习直接相关。以下是组织可以表明学习对成长很重要和必要的一些方式：

- **Have regular lunchtime meetings ("brownbags") where one person presents about a project they are working on in a new tech, or something they are investigating.** Rotate the presentations among team members and reward people for presenting.
- **When people attend conferences, have them share the new ideas through presentations or trip reports.** You can even host regular meetups or mini-conferences to increase networking and exposure to new technologies and ideas.
- **Encourage people to get certifications or external trainings.** You can help with this by covering costs of external trainings and forming study groups that are a part of normal work activity.

- **定期举行午餐时间会议（“棕包”），其中一个人介绍他们正在从事的新技术项目或他们正在调查的事情。**在团队成员之间轮换演示并奖励人们进行演示。
- **当人们参加会议时，让他们通过演示或旅行报告分享新想法。**您甚至可以举办定期聚会或小型会议，以增加网络和接触新技术和想法。
- **鼓励人们获得认证或外部培训。**您可以通过支付外部培训费用和组建作为正常工作活动一部分的学习小组来提供帮助。

## Ways to measure learning culture

## 衡量学习文化的方法

The most effective way to measure your climate for learning is to survey your employees. Use well-designed items and constructs that are rigorous and show good [psychometric properties](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics)  of [discriminant](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_validity)  and [convergent ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_validity)  validity and reliability (all statistical measures). The goal is for teams to feel that learning is encouraged and supported throughout the organization.

衡量您的学习氛围的最有效方法是调查您的员工。使用精心设计的项目和结构，这些项目和结构严格并显示出 [discriminant](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_validity) 和 [convergent] 的良好 [心理测量特性](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_validity)有效性和可靠性（所有统计测量)。目标是让团队感到整个组织都鼓励和支持学习。

Research presented in the article [An empirical analysis of the levers of control framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368207000049)  shows that you can measure learning culture based on the extent to which people agree or disagree with the following statements about their organization:

文章[控制框架杠杆的实证分析](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368207000049)中提出的研究表明，您可以根据人们同意的程度来衡量学习文化或不同意以下关于其组织的陈述：

- Learning is the key to improvement.
- Once we quit learning we endanger our future.
- Learning is viewed as an investment, not an expense. 

- 学习是进步的关键。
- 一旦我们放弃学习，我们就会危及我们的未来。
- 学习被视为一种投资，而不是一种支出。

Research from DORA shows that a climate for learning is a significant predictor of software delivery performance as well as organizational performance. Other studies show that climate for learning is predictive of organizational performance, so investments in learning, and a culture that values learning, is a good bet for organizations. 

DORA 的研究表明，学习氛围是软件交付绩效和组织绩效的重要预测指标。其他研究表明，学习氛围可以预测组织绩效，因此对学习的投资以及重视学习的文化对组织来说是一个不错的选择。
