**Note:** *Transformational leadership* is one of a set of capabilities that drive higher software delivery and organizational performance. These capabilities were discovered by the [DORA State of DevOps research program](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html), an independent, academically rigorous investigation into the practices and capabilities that drive high performance. To learn more, read our [DevOps resources](https://cloud.google.com/devops).

**注意：** *变革型领导*是推动更高软件交付和组织绩效的一系列能力之一。这些能力是由 [DORA State of DevOps 研究计划](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) 发现的，该计划是对推动高性能的实践和能力进行独立的、学术上严谨的调查。要了解更多信息，请阅读我们的 [DevOps 资源](https://cloud.google.com/devops)。

[DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/devops) research shows that effective leadership has a measurable, significant impact on software delivery outcomes. However, rather than driving these outcomes directly, effective transformational leaders influence software delivery performance by enabling the adoption of technical and product management capabilities and practices by practitioners, which in turn drives the outcomes leaders care about.

[DevOps 研究与评估 (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/devops) 研究表明，有效的领导力对软件交付成果具有可衡量的显着影响。然而，有效的转型领导者不是直接推动这些成果，而是通过让从业者采用技术和产品管理能力和实践来影响软件交付绩效，这反过来又推动了领导者关心的成果。

To study the role of leadership in DevOps transformations, DORA used a measure of transformational leadership that includes five dimensions. According to this model, validated in [Dimensions of transformational leadership: Conceptual and empirical extensions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984304000207)  (Rafferty, A. E., & Griffin, M. A.), the five characteristics of a transformational leader are the following:

为了研究领导力在 DevOps 转型中的作用，DORA 使用了包括五个维度的转型领导力度量。根据这个模型，在[变革型领导的维度：概念和经验扩展](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984304000207)（Rafferty, A. E., & Griffin, M. A.)中得到验证，五个变革型领导者的特征如下：

- **Vision**: Understands clearly where their team and the organization are going, and where they want the team to be in five years.
- **Inspirational communication**: Says positive things about the team; says things that make employees proud to be a part of their organization; encourages people to see changing conditions as situations full of opportunities.
- **Intellectual stimulation**: Challenges team members to think about old problems in new ways and to rethink some of their basic assumptions about their work; has ideas that force team members to rethink some things that they have never questioned before.
- **Supportive leadership**: Considers others' personal feelings before acting; behaves in a manner which is thoughtful of others' personal needs; sees that the interests of team members are given due consideration.
- **Personal recognition**: Commends team members when they do a better than average job; acknowledges improvement in quality of team members' work; personally compliments team members when they do outstanding work.

- **愿景**：清楚地了解他们的团队和组织的发展方向，以及他们希望团队在五年内达到的目标。
- **鼓舞人心的沟通**：对团队说积极的话；说出让员工为成为其组织的一员而自豪的话；鼓励人们将不断变化的条件视为充满机会的情况。
- **智力刺激**：挑战团队成员以新的方式思考旧问题，并重新思考他们对工作的一些基本假设；有一些想法迫使团队成员重新考虑他们以前从未质疑过的一些事情。
- **支持型领导**：行动前考虑他人的个人感受；以体贴他人个人需求的方式行事；看到团队成员的利益得到了应有的考虑。
- **个人认可**：当团队成员的工作表现优于平均水平时表扬他们；承认团队成员工作质量的改进；当团队成员表现出色时，他们会亲自表扬他们。

These five characteristics of transformational leadership are highly correlated with [software delivery performance](https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html). In fact, DORA observed statistically significant differences in leadership characteristics between high-, medium- and low- performing software delivery teams (see the [2017 State of DevOps Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2017.pdf)  pp12-19). High-performing teams reported having leaders with the strongest behaviors across all dimensions. In contrast, low-performing teams reported the lowest levels of these leadership characteristics.

变革型领导的这五个特征与[软件交付绩效](https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html)高度相关。事实上，DORA 观察到高绩效、中绩效和低绩效软件交付团队之间的领导特征存在统计学上的显着差异（参见 [2017 年 DevOps 状况报告](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc)/state-of-devops-2017.pdf) pp12-19)。高绩效团队报告说，领导者在所有方面都有最强的行为。相比之下，低绩效团队报告的这些领导特征水平最低。

What was most striking, however, was that teams with the least transformative leaders (the bottom third) were also far less likely to be high performers at software delivery — in fact, they were half as likely to exhibit high software delivery performance. This validates common experience: Though there are many DevOps and technology transformation success stories emerging from the grassroots, it is far easier to achieve success when you have effective, transformational leadership. 

然而，最引人注目的是，变革型领导者最少（倒数三分之一）的团队在软件交付方面表现出色的可能性也小得多——事实上，他们表现出高软件交付绩效的可能性只有一半。这验证了共同的经验：尽管有许多 DevOps 和技术转型的成功案例来自基层，但当您拥有有效的转型领导力时，取得成功要容易得多。

Moving beyond correlation to look at *how* effective transformational leaders achieve results, the results are interesting. The DORA team created a predictive model using a technique called [structural equation modeling](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_path_modeling)  to test the relationships between transformational leadership, a number of technical and product management practices, and software delivery and organizational performance. The validated model is shown in the following diagram. You can read the arrows as *driving* or *impacting* the capabilities and outcomes to which they point.

超越相关性，看看*有效的变革型领导者如何*取得成果，结果很有趣。 DORA 团队使用称为 [结构方程建模] (https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_path_modeling) 的技术创建了一个预测模型，以测试变革型领导、许多技术和产品管理实践以及软件交付和组织绩效。验证模型如下图所示。您可以将箭头解读为*驱动*或*影响*它们指向的能力和结果。

![Flowchart shows impact of leadership on practices and performance.](https://cloud.google.com/static/architecture/devops/images/transformational-leadership-validated-model.png)

The validated model shows that effective leaders impact software delivery and organizational performance *indirectly*, by enabling teams to adopt technical practices and lean product management practices. It is these practices that drive organizational outcomes such as higher software delivery performance and organizational performance. These capabilities also drive cultural change, as shown in the [overall research program](https://devops-research.com/research.html).

经过验证的模型表明，有效的领导者通过使团队能够采用技术实践和精益产品管理实践，*间接地*影响软件交付和组织绩效。正是这些实践推动了组织成果，例如更高的软件交付绩效和组织绩效。这些能力也推动了文化变革，如 [整体研究计划](https://devops-research.com/research.html) 所示。

## How to implement transformational leadership

## 如何实施变革型领导

Transformational leadership can be contrasted with transactional leadership, where employees are rewarded with money or prestige for complying with leadership instructions or punished for failing to follow them.

变革型领导可以与交易型领导形成对比，在后者中，员工因遵守领导指示而获得金钱或声望，或因未能遵守指示而受到惩罚。

However, transformational leaders, according to [Rafferty and Griffin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984304000207), "motivate followers to achieve performance beyond expectations by transforming followers' attitudes, beliefs, and values as opposed to simply gaining compliance."

然而，根据 [Rafferty 和 Griffin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984304000207) 的说法，变革型领导者“通过改变追随者的态度、信念和价值观来激励追随者实现超出预期的绩效而不是简单地获得合规性。”

DORA's research found evidence that the presence of leaders with transformational characteristics is not enough to achieve high performance. Looking at teams whose leaders were in the top 10% in terms of transformational leadership, the research found that they were not the very highest performers. In fact, these teams displayed significant variation in levels of software delivery performance.

DORA 的研究发现证据表明，具有变革性特征的领导者的存在不足以实现高绩效。研究发现，在变革型领导力方面，领导者在前 10% 的团队中，他们并不是表现最好的。事实上，这些团队在软件交付绩效水平方面表现出显着差异。

This result can be explained by the observation that leaders cannot achieve higher performance on their own. Success also depends on the implementation of effective technical, management, and product management practices, along with the other capabilities discussed in DORA's[ research](https://devops-research.com/research.html). It's essential that the transformational leadership behaviors, described above, are directed towards the implementation of these capabilities.

这一结果可以通过观察到领导者无法靠自己取得更高的绩效来解释。成功还取决于有效的技术、管理和产品管理实践的实施，以及 DORA [研究](https://devops-research.com/research.html) 中讨论的其他能力。如上所述，变革型领导行为必须针对这些能力的实施。

Take vision as an example. One way to create a clear vision for a software delivery team is to set measurable relative goals for [software delivery performance](https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html). [For example](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/double-half-quarter-lesson-from-book-richard-david-knott/)  Richard Herbert, CIO for Global Banking at Markets of HSBC, set every team the goal to "double the frequency of releases, half the number of low impact incidents, and quarter the number of high impact incidents."

以视觉为例。为软件交付团队创建清晰愿景的一种方法是为 [软件交付绩效] (https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html) 设定可衡量的相对目标。 [例如](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/double-half-quarter-lesson-from-book-richard-david-knott/) 汇丰全球银行业务首席信息官 Richard Herbert团队的目标是“发布频率加倍，低影响事件数量减半，高影响事件数量减半”。

There may be significant obstacles to achieving goals like the ones set by Richard Herbert. Again, leaders can use intellectual stimulation to help teams identify and remove obstacles to achieving higher performance. Perhaps team members believe that implementing [continuous testing](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation) will help them, but they've tried before and failed. Leaders can ask teams questions such as: "Why did it fail last time?", "What lessons did you learn?", "What would you do differently this time?", "What ideas would you like to try this time?" . 

实现理查德赫伯特设定的目标可能存在重大障碍。同样，领导者可以利用智力刺激来帮助团队识别和消除实现更高绩效的障碍。也许团队成员认为实施 [持续测试](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation) 会对他们有所帮助，但他们之前尝试过但失败了。领导者可以向团队提问，例如：“为什么上次失败了？”、“你学到了什么？”、“这次你会做些什么不同的事情？”、“这次你想尝试什么想法？” .

Personal recognition is also important, and must be directed such that it reinforces behaviors that help teams improve. Examples include trying experiments even if they don't work, or taking time to help other teams implement new ideas. Another example of effective personal recognition is e-commerce company Etsy, which at its annual engineering conference [gives an award](https://www.infoq.com/articles/crafting-resilient-culture/)  "to the engineer who inadvertently causes the most interesting or most learning-filled incident."

个人认可也很重要，必须加以引导，以加强有助于团队改进的行为。示例包括尝试实验，即使它们不起作用，或者花时间帮助其他团队实施新想法。另一个有效的个人认可的例子是电子商务公司 Etsy，它在其年度工程会议上[授予奖项](https://www.infoq.com/articles/crafting-resilient-culture/)“给那些不经意间引发最有趣或最有学问的事件。”

It's crucial that these behaviors are demonstrated consistently, and particularly when the team is under stress.

始终如一地展示这些行为至关重要，尤其是在团队处于压力之下时。

Finally, remember that leadership doesn't just mean executives and managers: anybody can be a leader. Almost all of these behaviors can be practiced by everybody in an organization. Consider how you can build them into your daily interactions with other people in your organization.

最后，请记住，领导力不仅仅意味着高管和经理：任何人都可以成为领导者。几乎所有这些行为都可以被组织中的每个人实践。考虑如何将它们构建到您与组织中其他人的日常互动中。

## How to measure transformational leadership

## 如何衡量变革型领导力

Transformational leadership can be measured directly by asking team members about the extent to which they believe leaders exhibit the behaviors described.

变革型领导可以通过询问团队成员他们认为领导者表现出所描述行为的程度来直接衡量。

The effects of transformational leadership are also measurable. For example, if a leader does an outstanding job of defining and communicating their vision, everybody in the organization should be able to describe that vision in a consistent way without having to look it up.

变革型领导的影响也是可以衡量的。例如，如果领导者在定义和传达他们的愿景方面做得非常出色，那么组织中的每个人都应该能够以一致的方式描述该愿景，而无需查阅它。
