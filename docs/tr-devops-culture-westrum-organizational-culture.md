# DevOps 文化：Westrum 组织文化

According to research by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), organizational culture that is high-trust and emphasizes information flow is predictive of software delivery performance and organizational performance in technology. The idea that a good culture that optimizes information flow is predictive of good outcomes is not a new idea; it is based on research by sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum. Westrum's [research](http://bmj.co/1BRGh5q)  included human factors in system safety, particularly in the context of accidents in technological domains such as aviation and healthcare.

根据 DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) 的研究，高度信任并强调信息流的组织文化可以预测软件交付绩效和组织在技术方面的绩效。优化信息流的良好文化可以预测良好结果的想法并不是一个新想法。它基于社会学家 Ron Westrum 博士的研究。 Westrum 的[研究](http://bmj.co/1BRGh5q) 包括系统安全中的人为因素，特别是在航空和医疗保健等技术领域的事故背景下。

In his work with these high risk, highly complex fields, Westrum noted that such a culture influences the way information flows through an organization. Westrum provides three characteristics of good information:

Westrum 在从事这些高风险、高度复杂领域的工作时指出，这种文化会影响信息在组织中流动的方式。 Westrum 提供了良好信息的三个特征：

1. It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered.
2. It is timely.
3. It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively.

1. 它为接收者需要回答的问题提供答案。
2、及时。
3. 以接收者可以有效使用的方式呈现。

In his research, he developed the following typology of organizational cultures.

在他的研究中，他开发了以下组织文化类型学。

| Pathological                  | Bureaucratic              | Generative               |
| ----------------------------- |------------------------- |------------------------ |
| **Power oriented**            | **Rule oriented**         | **Performance oriented** |
| Low cooperation               | Modest cooperation        | High cooperation         |
| Messengers "shot"             | Messengers neglected      | Messengers trained       |
| Responsibilities shirked      | Narrow responsibilities   | Risks are shared         |
| Bridging discouraged          | Bridging tolerated        | Bridging encouraged      |
| Failure leads to scapegoating | Failure leads to justice  | Failure leads to inquiry |
| Novelty crushed               | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented      |

|病理 |官僚主义 |生成 |
| | **以权力为导向** | **以规则为导向** | **以性能为导向** |
|低合作 |适度合作 |高度合作 |
|使者“出手” |被忽视的使者|训练有素的使者 |
|推卸责任 |狭窄的职责 |风险共担 |
|不鼓励桥接 |桥接容忍 |鼓励桥接 |
|失败导致替罪羊 |失败导致正义|失败导致询价 |
|新奇粉碎 |新奇导致问题 |新奇实施 |

Similar to Dr. Westrum's findings, DORA research shows that a high-trust, generative culture predicts software delivery and organizational performance in technology.

与 Westrum 博士的发现类似，DORA 的研究表明，高度信任的生成文化可以预测软件交付和技术中的组织绩效。

Research from [a large two-year study at Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) found similar results: that high performing teams need a culture of trust and [psychological safety](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/), meaningful work, and clarity. In the [2019 State of DevOps Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf) further analysis shows that a culture of psychological safety is predictive of software delivery performance, organizational performance, and productivity.

[在 Google 进行的一项为期两年的大型研究](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)的研究发现了类似的结果：高绩效团队需要信任文化和[心理安全](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/)、有意义的工作和清晰。在 [2019 年 DevOps 状态报告](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf) 中，进一步分析表明，心理安全文化可以预测软件交付绩效、组织绩效和生产力。

## How to implement organizational culture

## 如何实施组织文化

DORA research shows that changing the way people work changes culture; this is echoed in the work of John Shook, who spoke of his experiences in transforming culture: "The way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but instead to start by changing how people behave—what they do." This is seen in the technical, lean, and product management capabilities they have researched that influence culture.

DORA 研究表明，改变人们的工作方式会改变文化；这在约翰·舒克（John Shook）的作品中得到了回应，他谈到了他在转变文化方面的经历：“改变文化的方式不是首先改变人们的思维方式，而是从改变人们的行为方式——他们的所作所为开始。”这从他们研究的影响文化的技术、精益和产品管理能力中可以看出。

In addition, teams can identify helpful practices to create a generative culture that fosters information flow and trust by examining the six aspects of Westrum's model of organizational culture, focusing on those behaviors seen in the generative culture:

此外，团队可以通过检查 Westrum 组织文化模型的六个方面来确定有用的实践，以创建促进信息流和信任的生成文化，重点关注生成文化中的那些行为：

- High cooperation.
- Messengers are trained.
- Risks are shared.
- Bridging is encouraged.
- Failure leads to inquiry.
- Novelty is implemented.

- 高度合作。
- 信使受过训练。
- 风险是共担的。
- 鼓励桥接。
- 失败导致询问。
- 实施新颖性。

Based on these aspects, here are some practices you can implement to improve your culture: 

基于这些方面，您可以实施以下一些实践来改善您的文化：

- **High cooperation**. Create cross-functional teams that include representatives from each functional area of the software delivery process (business analysts, developers, quality engineers, ops, security, and so on). This practice lets everyone share the responsibility for building, deploying, and maintaining a product. It's also important that there is good cooperation within the team.
- **Train the messengers**. This means we want people to bring us bad news so we can make things better. Hold blameless postmortems. By removing blame, you remove fear; and by removing fear, you enable teams to surface problems and solve them more effectively. Also create and foster an environment where it is safe to take smart risks and fail, so that anyone can surface problems at any time—even without the ceremony of a postmortem.
- **Share risks**. Along with this, encourage shared responsibilities. Quality, availability, reliability and security are everyone's job. One way to improve the quality of your services is to ensure that developers share responsibility for maintaining their code in production. The improvement in collaboration that comes from sharing responsibility inherently reduces risk: The more eyes on the software delivery process, the more you'll avoid errors in process or planning. Automation also reduces risk, and with the right tool choice, can enable collaboration.
- **Encourage bridging**. Break down silos. In addition to creating cross-functional teams, techniques for breaking down silos include co-locating ops with the dev team; including ops in planning throughout the software delivery lifecycle; and implementing ChatOps. Another tip is to identify someone in the organization whose work you don't understand (or whose work frustrates you, like procurement) and invite them to coffee or lunch. Informal discussions help foster better communication, and you may understand why they do what they do—and you can come up with creative solutions together.
- **Let failure lead to inquiry**. Again, hold blameless postmortems. The response to failure shapes the culture of an organization. Blaming individuals for failures creates a negative culture. If instead, failures lead you to ask questions about what caused the failures and how you can keep them from happening again in the future, you've improved your technical system, your processes, and your culture.
- **Implement novelty**. Encourage experimentation. Giving employees freedom to explore new ideas can lead to great outcomes. Some companies give engineers time each week for experimentation. Others host internal hack days or mini-conferences to share ideas and collaborate. Many new features and products began this way. When you release your employees from habitual pathways and repetitive tasks, they can generate enormous value for your organization. And remember that novelty isn't limited to new products and features. Also encourage and reward improvements in process and ideas that help foster collaboration.

- **高度合作**。创建跨职能团队，其中包括来自软件交付流程各个职能领域的代表（业务分析师、开发人员、质量工程师、运营、安全等）。这种做法让每个人都分担构建、部署和维护产品的责任。团队内部的良好合作也很重要。
- **培训信使**。这意味着我们希望人们给我们带来坏消息，这样我们才能让事情变得更好。进行无可指责的事后分析。通过消除责备，您消除了恐惧；通过消除恐惧，您可以让团队发现问题并更有效地解决问题。还要创造和营造一个可以安全地承担明智风险和失败的环境，这样任何人都可以随时发现问题——即使没有进行验尸仪式。
- **分担风险**。与此同时，鼓励共同承担责任。质量、可用性、可靠性和安全性是每个人的工作。提高服务质量的一种方法是确保开发人员共同负责在生产中维护他们的代码。来自分担责任的协作改进从本质上降低了风险：对软件交付过程的关注越多，您就越能避免过程或计划中的错误。自动化还可以降低风险，并且通过正确的工具选择，可以实现协作。
- **鼓励桥接**。打破孤岛。除了创建跨职能团队外，打破孤岛的技术还包括与开发团队共同定位操作；包括在整个软件交付生命周期中进行规划的运营；并实施 ChatOps。另一个技巧是找出组织中你不理解的人（或者他们的工作让你感到沮丧，比如采购），并邀请他们喝咖啡或吃午饭。非正式讨论有助于促进更好的沟通，您可能会理解他们为什么会这样做，并且您可以一起提出创造性的解决方案。
- **让失败导致询问**。再次，进行无可指责的事后分析。对失败的反应塑造了一个组织的文化。将失败归咎于个人会产生一种消极的文化。相反，如果失败导致你询问导致失败的原因以及如何防止它们在未来再次发生，那么你已经改进了你的技术系统、流程和文化。
- **实现新颖性**。鼓励实验。让员工自由探索新想法可以带来巨大的成果。一些公司每周都会给工程师时间进行实验。其他人则举办内部黑客日或小型会议来分享想法和协作。许多新功能和产品都是以这种方式开始的。当您将员工从习惯性路径和重复性任务中解放出来时，他们可以为您的组织创造巨大的价值。请记住，新颖性不仅限于新产品和新功能。还鼓励和奖励有助于促进协作的流程和想法的改进。

## Common pitfalls of organizational culture

## 组织文化的常见陷阱

Organizational cultures with high information flow often encounter the following pitfalls:

具有高信息流的组织文化经常会遇到以下陷阱：

- Ignoring the importance of culture altogether, and treating technical work as a technology and process challenge only.
- Focusing only on local team cultures, and not reaching out to also understand how team cultures interact with the broader organizational culture.
- Not having enough support, or appropriate support, from leaders and managers for the necessary culture shift and transformation.
- Ignoring or punishing bad news. It's better to understand that failures are inevitable in complex systems, and treat them as opportunities to improve and learn.
- Not encouraging novelty. Admiral Grace Hopper, the famed computer science pioneer and inventor of the compiler, once said, "The most dangerous phrase in the language is 'we've always done it this way.'" Allowing and encouraging teams to experiment and try new things will make work better.

- 完全忽略文化的重要性，将技术工作仅视为技术和流程挑战。
- 只关注当地的团队文化，而不是去了解团队文化如何与更广泛的组织文化互动。
- 领导者和经理没有为必要的文化转变和转型提供足够的支持或适当的支持。
- 忽视或惩罚坏消息。最好理解失败在复杂系统中是不可避免的，并将其视为改进和学习的机会。
- 不鼓励新奇。著名的计算机科学先驱和编译器的发明者格蕾丝·霍珀海军上将曾经说过：“语言中最危险的短语是‘我们一直都是这样做的’。”让工作更好。

By focusing on the six aspects of Westrum's typology, teams and organizations can work thoughtfully and meaningfully toward improving their culture.

通过关注 Westrum 类型学的六个方面，团队和组织可以通过深思熟虑和有意义的方式来改善他们的文化。

## How to measure organizational culture 

## 如何衡量组织文化

Organizational culture is a perceptual measure, and therefore, best measured using survey methods. The Westrum survey measures, included here, are highly valid and reliable statistically.

组织文化是一种感知测量，因此最好使用调查方法进行测量。此处包含的 Westrum 调查措施在统计上是高度有效和可靠的。

- On my team, information is actively sought.
- Messengers are not punished when they deliver news of failures or other bad news.
- On my team, responsibilities are shared.
- On my team, cross-functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded.
- On my team, failure causes inquiry.
- On my team, new ideas are welcomed.

- 在我的团队中，积极寻求信息。
- 信使在传递失败消息或其他坏消息时不会受到惩罚。
- 在我的团队中，责任是分担的。
- 在我的团队中，鼓励和奖励跨职能协作。
- 在我的团队中，失败会导致询问。
- 在我的团队中，欢迎新想法。

Present these measures together—unlabeled and untitled—with responses ranging from Strongly Disagree (=1) to Neither Agree nor Disagree (=4) to Strongly Agree (=7). They are a latent construct, which means you can average their scores to provide a single score for your Westrum culture metric. If necessary, you can alter the items slightly to fit your context, but we recommend doing only minor changes in order to preserve the statistical properties. 

将这些措施放在一起（未标记和未命名），响应范围从非常不同意 (=1) 到既不同意也不不同意 (=4) 到非常同意 (=7)。它们是一个潜在的结构，这意味着您可以平均它们的分数，为您的 Westrum 文化指标提供一个分数。如有必要，您可以稍微更改项目以适应您的上下文，但我们建议仅进行较小的更改以保留统计属性。
