## DevOps engineer interview questions to ask

## DevOps 工程师要问的面试问题

### 1\. In what ways do you factor security into your DevOps process? How have you helped past teams develop greater security awareness?

### 1\.您在 DevOps 流程中如何考虑安全性？您是如何帮助过去的团队提高安全意识的？

Everything in DevOps starts with [security](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/166). DevOps automation helps bring software to market quicker than ever before, but it can also introduce crippling vulnerabilities just as fast. With the [average cost of a data breach](https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/how-secdevops-can-improve-your-software-and-protect-your-business-02193638) projected to hit $150 million this year, companies can ill afford to let security to take a backseat during their automation efforts.

DevOps 中的一切都始于 [security](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/166)。 DevOps 自动化有助于以前所未有的速度将软件推向市场，但它也可以同样快地引入严重的漏洞。 [数据泄露的平均成本](https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/how-secdevops-can-improve-your-software-and-protect-your-business-02193638) 预计将达到 1.5 亿美元今年，公司不能让安全在他们的自动化工作中退居次要位置。

DevOps engineers must lead the charge in securing applications. They don’t have to be network security experts, but they do have to operate from a mindset where security is the priority. This means incorporating tools into [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd?intcmp=701f2000000tjyaAAA) pipelines and helping the team focus on securing their applications from outside threats.

DevOps 工程师必须带头保护应用程序。他们不必是网络安全专家，但必须以安全为先的心态开展工作。这意味着将工具整合到 [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd?intcmp=701f2000000tjyaAAA) 管道中，并帮助团队专注于保护他们的应用程序外部威胁。

**[ 持续改进有何帮助？另请阅读：[如何设置 CI/CD 管道](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/1/cicd-pipeline-how-set-up?sc_cid=70160000000h0axaaq)。 ]**

### 2\. Can you give examples of things you always automate and others that you don’t? Can you tell me about a process that was a real challenge for you to automate?

### 2. 你能举例说明你总是自动化的东西和你不自动化的东西吗？你能告诉我一个对你来说自动化的真正挑战的过程吗？

A great DevOps engineer wants to automate everything, but they are also cognizant of processes where it just isn’t possible or automation might cause more harm than good. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins and Azure DevOps as well as Infrastructure as Code offerings should be second nature to them. Automation tools are their bread and butter, so it's essential they have absolute comfort working with them on day one.

一个伟大的 DevOps 工程师想要自动化一切，但他们也意识到不可能实现或自动化可能弊大于利的流程。 Jenkins 和 Azure DevOps 等持续集成/持续交付 (CI/CD) 工具以及基础设施即代码产品应该是他们的第二天性。自动化工具是他们的基础，因此他们在第一天就绝对舒适地使用它们是至关重要的。

### 3\. Describe your ideal working environment for your DevOps team. What have you learned working closely with operations?

### 3. 描述您的 DevOps 团队理想的工作环境。您在与运营密切合作中学到了什么？

DevOps isn’t a job for a lone wolf programmer who goes into a panic attack when someone approaches their cubicle.

DevOps 不是一个孤狼程序员的工作，当有人接近他们的小隔间时，他们会陷入恐慌。

One of the key tenets of DevOps is collaboration. People from a variety of departments come together to craft the best software solution possible. The DevOps engineer is tasked with breaking down the differences to help everyone work towards a common goal. This isn’t a job for a lone wolf programmer who goes into a panic attack when someone approaches their cubicle. 

DevOps 的关键原则之一是协作。来自不同部门的人员齐聚一堂，尽可能地制定最佳的软件解决方案。 DevOps 工程师的任务是打破差异，帮助每个人朝着共同的目标努力。这不是一个孤狼程序员的工作，当有人接近他们的小隔间时，他们会陷入恐慌。

The DevOps engineer must be personable as they have to interface with many different team members on a daily basis. They must be comfortable wearing the operations hat and helping the development team understand operations' needs and perspective.

DevOps 工程师必须风度翩翩，因为他们必须每天与许多不同的团队成员打交道。他们必须能够轻松地戴上运营帽子，并帮助开发团队了解运营的需求和观点。

### 4\. Tell me about a few scripts you’ve developed in the past that have been critical to your DevOps success.

### 4. 告诉我您过去开发的一些脚本，这些脚本对您的 DevOps 成功至关重要。

Scripting is one of those critical skills for DevOps engineers. I’m sure you’ve heard that old saying, “Life would be so much easier if there were two of me.” Scripting is your cloning machine. Whether it's Python, Powershell, or some other flavor, scripting is a powerful tool to help you do more with less. A DevOps engineer doesn’t have to be a full fledged programmer, but they do need to know how to leverage scripting to make their job easier.

脚本编写是 DevOps 工程师的关键技能之一。我相信你听过那句老话，“如果有我两个人，生活会容易得多。”脚本是您的克隆机。无论是 Python、Powershell 还是其他风格，脚本编写都是一种强大的工具，可帮助您事半功倍。 DevOps 工程师不必是一个成熟的程序员，但他们确实需要知道如何利用脚本来简化他们的工作。

### 5\. Can you tell me about a release that went really wrong? How did you work to stabilize the environment? What did you learn from the experience?

### 5. 你能告诉我一个真正出错的版本吗？你是如何努力稳定环境的？你从这次经历中学到了什么？

Even the best teams make mistakes. A bug gets missed during testing. A configuration gets bobbled due to poor communication. Before you know it, all hell is breaking loose. It’s not fun when you are in the middle of the storm, but how someone handles those stressful moments is a key component of the job. DevOps engineers need to be confident and decisive in their decision making when it really counts.

即使是最好的球队也会犯错。在测试过程中会遗漏一个错误。由于沟通不畅，配置变得混乱。在你知道之前，所有的地狱都在崩溃。当您身处风暴之中时，这并不有趣，但如何处理那些压力时刻是工作的关键组成部分。 DevOps 工程师需要在真正重要的决策中充满信心和果断。

Every second can feel like an eternity when a system is down so there is no time for second guessing or carefully mulling over available options. You have to make the best decision based on the information at hand, and the various competing business interests tugging at you.

当系统停机时，每一秒都感觉像是永恒，因此没有时间进行第二次猜测或仔细考虑可用选项。您必须根据手头的信息以及各种相互竞争的商业利益来做出最佳决策。

### 6\. How do you judge success, in the context of yourself and the DevOps team as a whole?

### 6\.在您自己和整个 DevOps 团队的背景下，您如何判断成功？

Your DevOps engineer should be pushing the team to constantly improve, and establish measurable goals to judge success.

您的 DevOps 工程师应该推动团队不断改进，并建立可衡量的目标来判断成功。

DevOps is inherently about improvement. You are trying to make your build and deployment process more efficient, more secure, and more highly automated. You are never done. Your DevOps engineer should be pushing the team to constantly improve, and establish measurable goals to judge success. Without measurable goals, it’s hard to keep track of what you were striving for and to know if you actually got there.

DevOps 本质上是关于改进的。您正在努力使您的构建和部署过程更高效、更安全和更高度自动化。你永远不会完成。您的 DevOps 工程师应该推动团队不断改进，并建立可衡量的目标来判断成功。如果没有可衡量的目标，就很难跟踪您的奋斗目标并知道您是否真的达到了目标。

### 7\. Tell me about your favorite DevOps tools. What makes them great in your opinion? What are some new tools, or fresh features of your existing toolset, that you’ve uncovered recently?

### 7. 告诉我你最喜欢的 DevOps 工具。在您看来，是什么让它们变得伟大？您最近发现了哪些新工具或现有工具集的新功能？

Every DevOps engineer should be blessed with an undying curiosity and a thirst for learning. DevOps toolsets are constantly evolving so an engineer can’t simply rely on how they’ve always done things. They have to keep up. DevOps tends to play with a lot of cutting edge technologies.

每个 DevOps 工程师都应该拥有不朽的好奇心和学习的渴望。 DevOps 工具集在不断发展，因此工程师不能简单地依赖他们一直以来的工作方式。他们必须跟上。 DevOps 倾向于使用许多尖端技术。

When your team comes to you asking how [serverless](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/2/serverless-how-explain-plain-english "How to explain serverless in plain English") will fit into the existing DevOps process, you need to know enough about the cloud technology to give them direction. Looking ahead, [artificial intelligence](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/426) and [machine learning](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/346) are natural compliments to DevOps that engineers will have to embrace to decipher patterns and spot problems.

当您的团队向您询问 [无服务器](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/2/serverless-how-explain-plain-english“如何用简单的英语解释无服务器”) 将如何适应现有的在 DevOps 过程中，您需要对云技术有足够的了解才能为他们指明方向。展望未来，[人工智能](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/426)和[机器学习](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/346) 是工程师对 DevOps 的自然补充必须拥抱破译模式和发现问题。

DevOps engineers are one of the most important components of the DevOps team. They help automate the software build and deployment process and continually tighten the flow to make it more efficient. They help manage the chaos of competing priorities between developers and operations. 

DevOps 工程师是 DevOps 团队中最重要的组成部分之一。它们有助于自动化软件构建和部署过程，并不断收紧流程以提高效率。它们有助于管理开发人员和运营人员之间竞争优先级的混乱局面。

It’s not easy finding great DevOps engineers in this exceedingly tight talent market, but these questions should help you zero in on candidates who are passionate about their craft and have fought enough battles to bring that confidence and seasoned expertise to benefit your organization.

在这个极其紧张的人才市场中找到优秀的 DevOps 工程师并不容易，但是这些问题应该可以帮助你将那些对自己的技艺充满热情并且已经打了足够多的战斗以带来信心和经验丰富的专业知识来使你的组织受益的候选人归零。
