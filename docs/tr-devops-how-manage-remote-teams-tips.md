您是在领导或在某些人远程工作的 DevOps 团队中工作吗？建立健康的文化带来了一些挑战 - 但专家表示远程团队可以成为协作和灵活性的大师

February 27, 2020

We know by now that [DevOps](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/76) requires more than the right tools and methodologies to succeed. It’s a mindset and cultural shift – and it’s not easy. Pair this with the fact that more IT work is being done by remote teams, and the culture challenges begin to pile up.

我们现在知道 [DevOps](https://enterprisersproject.com/taxonomy/term/76) 需要的不仅仅是正确的工具和方法才能取得成功。这是一种思维方式和文化转变——这并不容易。将此与远程团队正在完成更多 IT 工作以及文化挑战开始堆积的事实相结合。

In [a recent article](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/1/devops-culture-5-questions "DevOps culture: 5 questions to ask about yours"), Mark Runyon, principal consultant for [Improving] (https://improving.com/), made the connection between these two issues clear when he noted that one way to assess the health of your DevOps culture is to look at how spread out teams members are.

在[最近的一篇文章](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/1/devops-culture-5-questions“DevOps 文化：关于你的文化的 5 个问题”) 中，Mark Runyon，[Improving] 的首席顾问(https://improving.com/)，当他指出评估 DevOps 文化健康状况的一种方法是查看团队成员的分布情况时，他清楚地表明了这两个问题之间的联系。

“In an ideal world, the whole scrum team is occupying the same space,” Runyon wrote. “The same space doesn’t just mean they work in the same building or are spread across separate floors or departmental cubicle farms. The same space means the team is within arm’s reach of one another.”

“在理想的世界中，整个 Scrum 团队都占据着相同的空间，”Runyon 写道。 “相同的空间不仅仅意味着他们在同一栋建筑中工作，或者分布在不同的楼层或部门隔间农场。相同的空间意味着团队彼此相距一臂之内。”

Runyon makes a compelling case for co-located DevOps teams: “Being co-located allows the team to easily call an impromptu meeting to discuss a problem that has arisen. It allows select members of the team to quickly break off to whiteboard a solution for a feature that is failing to gel. In addition to removing blockers in real time, working in a dynamic environment like this builds bonds between employees that can be difficult to replicate when the team is working remotely or simply spread across different cities, buildings, or floors within the organization,” he wrote .

Runyon 为共处一地的 DevOps 团队提供了一个令人信服的案例：“共处一地允许团队轻松召开临时会议来讨论出现的问题。它允许团队中的选定成员快速中断，为无法凝胶化的功能制定解决方案。除了实时消除阻碍之外，在这样的动态环境中工作还能建立员工之间的纽带，当团队远程工作或只是分散在组织内的不同城市、建筑物或楼层时，这种纽带可能难以复制，”他写道。 .

## Remote work is a growing trend

## 远程工作是一种增长趋势

As Runyon notes in his article, the remote work trend isn't going anywhere – teams just have to work harder to shorten the distance and [build culture on dispersed teams](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/12/remote-teams-5-culture-tips) if they want to succeed with DevOps.

正如 Runyon 在他的文章中指出的那样，远程工作趋势不会随处可见——团队只需要更加努力地工作以缩短距离并[在分散的团队中建立文化](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/12/remote-teams-5-culture-tips)，如果他们想在 DevOps 上取得成功。

This can be especially tricky for large organizations, says Helen Beal, DevOpsologist at [Ranger4](https://www.ranger4.com/). “While it is the ideal to have the teams colocated, this often just isn’t practical or even possible, particularly for organizations that are transitioning from a siloed, waterfall culture to one of small, autonomous squads,” she says.

[Ranger4](https://www.ranger4.com/) 的 DevOpsologist Helen Beal 说，这对于大型组织来说尤其棘手。 “虽然让团队共处一地是理想的做法，但这通常是不切实际的，甚至是不可能的，特别是对于正在从孤立的瀑布文化过渡到小型、自治的团队之一的组织，”她说。

"Most people can’t or don’t want to move to another city or country, and they shouldn’t be expected to."

“大多数人不能或不想搬到另一个城市或国家，也不应该期望他们这样做。”

“When organizations are very large, with tens of thousands of people in technology teams, even if they are in the same country they will be across multiple locations, potentially hundreds or thousands of miles apart,” says Beal. “Additionally, many organizations have models where they outsource parts of the value stream like development, testing, and operations, frequently to different countries. The cost of changing these models is huge, incredibly disruptive and likely causes a lot of headaches for HR because of employee rights. Most people can’t or don’t want to move to another city or country, and they shouldn’t be expected to.”

“当组织非常大时，技术团队中有数万人，即使他们在同一个国家，他们也会跨越多个地点，可能相距数百或数千英里，”比尔说。 “此外，许多组织都有将开发、测试和运营等价值流的一部分外包给不同国家的模式。改变这些模型的成本是巨大的、令人难以置信的破坏性，并且可能会因为员工权利而给 HR 带来很多麻烦。大多数人不能或不想搬到另一个城市或国家，也不应该期望他们这样做。”

## Where remote DevOps teams excel long-term

## 远程 DevOps 团队长期擅长的地方

It’s worth it to overcome the barriers created by dispersed teams. Doing so can help cement a culture that can survive more difficult DevOps challenges down the road, says Hina Popal, senior agile practitioner and Scrum Master at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en).

克服分散团队造成的障碍是值得的。 [Red Hat] (https://www.redhat.com/en) 的高级敏捷实践者和 Scrum 大师 Hina Popal 说，这样做有助于巩固一种文化，能够在未来更艰难的 DevOps 挑战中幸存下来。

"Through this process DevOps people learn to become experts at collaboration and flexibility." 

“通过这个过程，DevOps 人们学会成为协作和灵活性方面的专家。”

"There is a bigger up front cost when forming a remote team, but through this process people learn to become experts at collaboration and flexibility,” says Popal. “It's much harder to get the team to find their rhythm. You can't see people who are sleep deprived at the water cooler, you don't really understand that people are sacrificing their work-life balance when trying to find a timezone that works when you are distributed over more than one continent, and overall it's hard to learn others quirks from just having meetings via video call or chatting on a messaging app.”

“组建远程团队需要更大的前期成本，但通过这个过程，人们学习成为协作和灵活性方面的专家，”Popal 说，“让团队找到自己的节奏要困难得多。你看不到在饮水机上睡眠不足的人，你真的不明白，当你分布在一个以上的大陆时，人们试图找到一个有效的时区时，他们正在牺牲他们的工作与生活的平衡，总的来说很难学习其他人只是通过视频电话开会或在消息应用程序上聊天的怪癖。”

“That being said,” she continues, “when teams work through all of these difficult problems, they have already faced some of their hardest challenges. That means they can handle many things as a team because they went through these experiences up front.”

“话虽如此，”她继续说道，“当团队解决所有这些难题时，他们已经面临了一些最艰难的挑战。这意味着他们可以作为一个团队处理很多事情，因为他们预先经历了这些经历。”

In fact, avoiding the challenges of remote work can create its own problems. For instance, learning how to communicate with team members effectively is critical for all teams – whether they are in the same room or not.

事实上，避免远程工作的挑战会产生其自身的问题。例如，学习如何有效地与团队成员沟通对所有团队都至关重要——无论他们是否在同一个房间。

"Remote Agile/DevOps work is not just possible; it works,” says Robert Reeves, CTO of [Datical](https://www.datical.com/). “I've seen developers in the _same room_ use Slack to communicate. I have also seen impromptu Slack calls across continents. So the argument to keep the team within arm's reach for the sake of having impromptu meetings doesn't fly. In fact, that [can be a negative](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2017.0239).”

[Datical](https://www.datical.com/) 的首席技术官 Robert Reeves 说：“远程敏捷/DevOps 工作不仅是可能的，而且是有效的。”沟通。我还看到跨大陆的即兴 Slack 电话。因此，为了召开即兴会议而将团队保持在触手可及的范围内的论点并不成立。事实上，这[可能是负面的](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2017.0239)。”

“Having the team in arm’s reach also perpetuates a DevOps anti-pattern: enforcing the need for face time with the boss.”

“让团队触手可及也延续了 DevOps 的反模式：强制要求与老板面对面。”

“Having the team in arm’s reach also perpetuates a DevOps anti-pattern: enforcing the need for face time with the boss,” Reeves adds. “As a manager, if you feel the need to physically see your team in order to see their progress, your ability to gauge productivity via KPIs is really bad. You should either fix that or consider not being a manager."

“让团队触手可及也延续了 DevOps 的反模式：强制要求与老板面对面，”Reeves 补充道。 “作为一名经理，如果你觉得有必要亲眼看看你的团队以了解他们的进步，那么你通过 KPI 衡量生产力的能力真的很糟糕。你要么解决这个问题，要么考虑不做经理。”

## How to manage remote DevOps teams with a healthy culture

## 如何管理具有健康文化的远程 DevOps 团队

Below are five ways to tackle the challenges of remote DevOps work head on and succeed, experts say:

专家表示，以下是应对远程 DevOps 工作挑战并取得成功的五种方法：

### 1\. Get teams together periodically

### 1\.定期让团队聚在一起

“Remote working is of great benefit to employers and employees both in terms of cost, productivity, and quality of life. What I have found to be very effective is to get the members of the team together for a few days a quarter or so; just a small amount of face time with people helps build the relationships in a way that sticks, and the remote working works even better when the human feels they know the other human, no matter where in the world they may be," says Beal.

“远程工作在成本、生产力和生活质量方面对雇主和雇员都有很大好处。我发现非常有效的是每季度让团队成员聚在一起几天；与人的少量面对面时间有助于以一种持久的方式建立关系，当人们觉得他们认识另一个人时，远程工作的效果会更好，无论他们身在何处，”比尔说。

### 2\. Invest in the right tools

### 2. 投资正确的工具

“Many of our agile and DevOps teams include full-time or part-time remote team members including product managers, software engineers, scientists, and more. Remote work does require careful execution and special techniques compared to co-located teams, however. We use gobs of tech tools to support our remote workers. We make extensive use of G-Suite, Zoom web conferencing, GitHub, Google Jamboards, Slack, virtual Miro brainstorming boards, Owl video conferencing, and anything else we can get our hands on to make remote work more productive and enjoyable,” says Matt Poepsel, senior vice president for [The Predictive Index](https://www.predictiveindex.com/).

“我们的许多敏捷和 DevOps 团队都包括全职或兼职的远程团队成员，包括产品经理、软件工程师、科学家等。然而，与同地团队相比，远程工作确实需要谨慎的执行和特殊的技术。我们使用大量技术工具来支持我们的远程工作者。我们广泛使用 G-Suite、Zoom 网络会议、GitHub、Google Jamboards、Slack、虚拟 Miro 头脑风暴板、Owl 视频会议以及我们可以使用的任何其他工具，以使远程工作更加高效和愉快，”马特说Poepsel，[The Predictive Index](https://www.predictiveindex.com/) 的高级副总裁。

### 3\. Over-communicate 

### 3. 过度沟通

"CircleCI has always embraced remote work. As a company comprised of engineers working to solve problems for other engineers around the world, we believe that being distributed allows for 24/7 support for our users. Given our distribution, we've been very intentional and deliberate about how to succeed as a team from the start, and there are plenty of things we learned along the way. One of the intentions we explicitly agreed upon was over-communicating, and it has proven to be extremely useful. Starting out as a widely-distributed team of mostly folks who had never met in person, we hoped over-communication would help us at least avoid not communicating enough, and, at best, figure out what communication level we need,” says Rob Zuber, CTO at [CircleCI.](https://circleci.com/)

“CircleCI 一直支持远程工作。作为一家由致力于为世界各地其他工程师解决问题的工程师组成的公司，我们相信分布式可以为我们的用户提供 24/7 的支持。考虑到我们的分布，我们一直非常有意并从一开始就考虑如何作为一个团队取得成功，一路上我们学到了很多东西。我们明确同意的意图之一是过度沟通，事实证明这是非常有用的。开始作为一个分布广泛的团队，主要由从未见过面的人组成，我们希望过度沟通能帮助我们至少避免沟通不足，并且最多能弄清楚我们需要什么样的沟通水平，”首席技术官 Rob Zuber 说。 [CircleCI.](https://circleci.com/)

### 4\. Make meetings intentional

### 4. 让会议有目的地

“We teach our meeting leaders to think about the nature of their meeting prior to kickoff. Is it a brainstorming meeting? How can we use a virtual whiteboard? Do we need to make a decision? How will we gather critical inputs from remote team members? If one person is remote, we try to make sure every person in the meeting is visible on camera. We always give the speaking right-of-way to remote workers before those in the room,” says Poepsel.

“我们教我们的会议负责人在开始前考虑会议的性质。这是一个头脑风暴会议吗？我们如何使用虚拟白板？我们需要做决定吗？我们将如何从远程团队成员那里收集关键输入？如果一个人是远程的，我们会尽量确保会议中的每个人都可以在摄像机上看到。我们总是在房间里的人之前为远程工作人员提供发言权，”Poepsel 说。

### 5\. Explore new ways of working

### 5. 探索新的工作方式

“We’ve seen success with a collaboration process called ‘ping-pong’ pairing, which is similar in principle to traditional pair-programming, but asynchronous. Rather than navigating/commenting on code the other person is writing in real-time and switching driver/navigator roles often, we let our respective daily schedules dictate the rhythm. This still retains the usual pair-programming benefit of knowledge sharing, while actually allowing more than two people to participate in the process,” says Zuber.

“我们已经看到称为‘乒乓’配对的协作过程取得了成功，它在原理上类似于传统的配对编程，但异步。与其在另一个人实时编写的代码中导航/评论并经常切换驱动程序/导航员角色，我们不如让各自的日程安排来决定节奏。这仍然保留了通常的结对编程知识共享的好处，同时实际上允许两个以上的人参与该过程，”Zuber 说。

The work that Zuber’s team has put into learning how to work effectively as a dispersed DevOps team has paid off. “During an in-person offsite a few months ago, one of our teams asked: 'If we had a choice, would we choose to be a remote team distributed across distant time zones, or would we rather be at least closer together?' The answer was: 'We wouldn't want to change a thing,'” he said.

Zuber 的团队在学习如何作为分散的 DevOps 团队有效工作方面付出的努力已经得到了回报。 “几个月前，在一次异地现场面对面交流中，我们的一个团队问道：‘如果我们有选择，我们会选择成为分布在遥远时区的远程团队，还是宁愿至少更靠近一点？’答案是：'我们不想改变任何事情，'”他说。
