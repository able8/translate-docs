# The Secret of Employee Engagement

# 员工敬业度的秘密

October 3rd, 2019

In “ [Manage by Context, not Control](https://pulseasync.com/operators/future-remote-working)” I gave a long introductory premise explaining how the work paradigm has shifted. (If you haven't read it yet, I would recommend giving that a read first as it instills some ground rules that will come in handy not only here but also in upcoming essays.) Specifically, I talked about how modern workers are not interchangeable anymore in terms of their skill level. Instead, they are increasingly specialized. As the world transitions to one of knowledge workers, skillsets are less interchangeable and way more specialized than ever before.

在“[按上下文管理，而不是控制](https://pulseasync.com/operators/future-remote-working)”中，我给出了一个很长的介绍性前提，解释了工作范式是如何转变的。（如果你还没有读过，我建议你先读一读，因为它灌输了一些基本规则，不仅在这里而且在即将到来的文章中都会派上用场。)具体来说，我谈到了现代工人是如何不可互换的就他们的技能水平而言。相反，他们越来越专业化。随着世界向知识工作者的转变，技能组合的可互换性越来越低，而且比以往任何时候都更加专业化。

People are the single most important asset in modern organizations. As talent scarcity is increasingly becoming one of the hardest problems, the ability to assess, _recruit_, _manage_ and _retain_ talent is going to be an invaluable skill.

人员是现代组织中最重要的唯一资产。随着人才稀缺日益成为最棘手的问题之一，评估、_招聘_、_管理_和_保留_人才的能力将成为一项无价的技能。

To overcome talent scarcity more and more companies are adopting one or more [remote work frameworks](https://pulseasync.com/operators/frameworks-for-remote-working), and with physical proximity out of the equation, the available talent pool is certainly way bigger. As more companies are beginning to embrace remote work, recruitment will get easier, but my hypothesis is that retaining talent will get considerably harder.

为了克服人才稀缺的问题，越来越多的公司正在采用一种或多种 [远程工作框架](https://pulseasync.com/operators/frameworks-for-remote-working)，并且在物理距离之外，可用的人才游泳池肯定要大得多。随着越来越多的公司开始接受远程工作，招聘会变得更容易，但我的假设是留住人才会变得更加困难。

Generally speaking, a remote environment removes friction. While this lack of friction comes with a lot of well-known benefits (competitive salary, flexible working hours, better individual time allocation, etc.), it also means that changing jobs will get easier and consequently, the ability to retain talent will matter a whole lot more in the future than it does today.

一般来说，远程环境消除了摩擦。虽然这种摩擦的减少带来了许多众所周知的好处（有竞争力的工资、灵活的工作时间、更好的个人时间分配等），但这也意味着换工作会变得更容易，因此，留住人才的能力将很重要未来会比今天多得多。

In this essay, we’re going to get acquainted with the prevailing wisdom on motivating and retaining employees, see if it’s still relevant, and arrive at some meaningful conclusions.

在这篇文章中，我们将熟悉关于激励和留住员工的流行智慧，看看它是否仍然相关，并得出一些有意义的结论。

On to the write-up.

继续写。

**What is Effective Employee Engagement?**

**什么是有效的员工敬业度？**

When it comes down to motivating and retaining employees there are two words that have been used by HR departments for years. Those words are “employee engagement.” Run a google search for “employee engagement,” and you’ll see what I mean.

当谈到激励和留住员工时，人力资源部门多年来一直使用两个词。这些词是“员工敬业度”。在谷歌上搜索“员工参与度”，你就会明白我的意思。

![Results showing what people think is employees engagement](http://pulseasync.com/assets/results-employees-engagement.png)

To quote one definition:

_Employee engagement represents the levels of enthusiasm and connection employees have with their organization. It’s a measure of how motivated people are to put in extra effort for their organization, and a sign of how committed they are to staying there._

引用一个定义：

_员工敬业度代表员工与组织的热情和联系程度。这是衡量人们为他们的组织付出额外努力的积极性的衡量标准，也是他们对留在那里的承诺程度的标志。_

I’ll spare you the extensive clicking; here’s how the thinking goes for most of them: “Employee engagement" leads to "job satisfaction" and "employee happiness," and these then lead to “higher motivation and performance,” and eventually, “better results.”

我不会给你大量的点击；大多数人的想法是这样的：“员工敬业度”会带来“工作满意度”和“员工幸福感”，然后会带来“更高的动力和绩效”，并最终带来“更好的结果”。

The basic assumption is that engaged employees deliver high-quality performance and this begs the question, how do we “engage” employees? The answer is spend a lot of money on frequent/big HR initiatives, sponsored group activities, celebrations to build camaraderie and make sure people have fun, and, for employees who are struggling, performance improvement plans.

基本假设是敬业的员工提供高质量的绩效，这就引出了一个问题，我们如何“聘用”员工？答案是在频繁/大型人力资源计划、赞助团体活动、庆祝活动上花费大量资金以建立友情并确保人们玩得开心，以及为陷入困境的员工制定绩效改进计划。

The idea is well-intentioned but fundamentally flawed, as too often “employee engagement" is treated like the end-game, rather than serving customers and getting results. For years, companies have been optimizing for what is – to some extent – a bad proxy, completely losing sight of the real target over time. 

这个想法是善意的，但从根本上是有缺陷的，因为“员工敬业度”经常被当作最终游戏对待，而不是服务客户并取得成果。多年来，公司一直在优化——在某种程度上——一个坏的代理，随着时间的推移完全看不到真正的目标。

The job of management is not just about building loyalty, retention and career progression, and about implementing structures to ensure employee engagement and happiness. As obvious as it may sound, people don't need to be entertained at work to stay motivated, aligned or to really throw themselves into their work. The job of a great leader is not to entertain people, but to ensure that all team members are high performers who do amazing work and challenge one another.

管理的工作不仅仅是建立忠诚度、保留率和职业发展，还包括实施确保员工敬业度和幸福感的结构。听起来很明显，人们不需要在工作中获得娱乐来保持动力、保持一致或真正全身心地投入到工作中。一位伟大的领导者的工作不是取悦他人，而是确保所有团队成员都是表现出色的人，他们能够出色地完成工作并相互挑战。

The actual questions are: How can leaders motivate people? What’s the actual driver for individual motivations? And what actually encourages alignment and enables the best individual work?

实际问题是：领导者如何激励员工？个人动机的实际驱动因素是什么？什么实际上鼓励了一致性并实现了最好的个人工作？

The answer is clear and continuous communication about the **context of the work to be done.** ‍

答案是关于**要完成的工作的背景的明确和持续的沟通。**

In practice, this means telling people: "Here's exactly where we are and here's what we are trying to accomplish." Employees at all levels want and need to understand not only the particular work they're assigned, but also the larger story of the way the business works, the challenges the company faces and the competitive landscape.

实际上，这意味着告诉人们：“这正是我们所处的位置，这就是我们正在努力实现的目标。”各个级别的员工不仅希望并需要了解分配给他们的特定工作，而且还需要了解有关企业运作方式、公司面临的挑战和竞争格局的更大故事。

‍

People need context to really do their best work.

人们需要上下文才能真正做到最好。

![What are the individual responsibilities versus the actual surrounding context](http://pulseasync.com/assets/employees-engagement-context.png)

The more management time is spent on clearly communicating the context of the work to be done, the fewer the necessary policies, approvals, and incentives. On the other hand, the more an organization spends on planning employee engagement initiatives, the more this reveals about their fundamental internal flaws.

管理层花费的时间越多，清楚地传达要完成的工作的背景，所需的政策、批准和激励就越少。另一方面，组织在规划员工敬业度计划上花费的越多，就越能揭示出他们的基本内部缺陷。

Truly understanding how the business works is the most valuable kind of learning – much more productive and appealing than "employee development" training – yet, this happens to be the most neglected area.

真正了解企业的运作方式是最有价值的学习方式——比“员工发展”培训更有成效和吸引力——然而，这恰好是最容易被忽视的领域。

Rather than focusing on this:

![Image to show how employees aren't interested in the what](http://pulseasync.com/assets/employees-engagement-without-purpose.png)

Focus on this:

![Image to show how employees aren't interested in the why and broader scope of their actions](http://pulseasync.com/assets/employees-engagement-with-purpose.png)

Don’t ask, “How can we keep employees engaged?” A much better question is, “How can we create this context in which the work is to be done and make sure everyone is regularly exposed to it?”

不要问，“我们如何才能让员工保持敬业度？”一个更好的问题是，“我们如何才能创造这种完成工作的环境，并确保每个人都定期接触到它？”

What does it mean to create context about the work to be done? At its core, there are a handful of fundamental ingredients: the **message** (what you are going to tell people), the **firehose** (how you are going to distribute that message), and the **rhythm ** (how often you're going to do it).

为要完成的工作创建上下文是什么意思？在其核心，有一些基本要素：**信息**（您将要告诉人们的内容）、**firehose**（您将如何分发该信息）和**节奏**（你打算多久做一次）。

**Find the Message**

**查找消息**

The message is the fundamental building block, and it’s not what you say, it’s what people understand. It’s what people read and actually comprehend. It’s the inner voice that over time people start to hear in the back of their minds.

信息是基本的组成部分，它不是你说的，而是人们理解的。这是人们阅读并实际理解的内容。随着时间的推移，人们开始在他们的脑海中听到内心的声音。

![Image to show how leadership should take care of internal communication](http://pulseasync.com/assets/craft-announcements.png)

In [Understanding Media of Internal Communication](http://about:blank), I described the difference between hot and cold messages. In hot messages, information is transmitted in high definition; the meaning of what’s being communicated is right in your face. Because there is no guesswork (the hard work has been done upfront by the presenter), they tend to be all-encompassing and require low participation. Conversely, in cold messages a lot is left unsaid, a lot of guesswork is required in order to read between the lines, and the reader has to fill in the gaps. They have low engagement, but high participation.

在 [了解内部传播的媒体](http://about:blank)中，我描述了冷热消息的区别。在热点信息中，信息以高清晰度传输；所传达内容的含义就在您的脸上。因为没有猜测（演示者已经预先完成了艰苦的工作)，所以它们往往包罗万象，需要的参与度很低。相反，在冷消息中，有很多没有说出来，需要进行大量猜测才能在字里行间阅读，而读者必须填补空白。他们的参与度低，但参与度高。

Meaningful context is built through hot messages: high-resolution information where nothing is left unsaid, the meaning is clear and the guesswork is reduced to a minimum.

有意义的上下文是通过热门信息构建的：高分辨率信息，没有什么未说的，意思很清楚，猜测减少到最低限度。

Back to the initial premise: how one can go about deciding what needs to be communicated to create context.

回到最初的前提：如何决定需要传达什么来创建上下文。

There’s no single recipe for understanding what the content of your messages should be. One way to understand it is to identify the _knowledge gaps_. In other words, to understand what matters most to you and your business and on what scale people are aware of it.

没有单一的方法可以理解您的消息内容应该是什么。理解它的一种方法是识别_知识差距_。换句话说，了解什么对您和您的企业最重要，以及人们对它的了解程度。

Your content should focus both on the missing gaps and the reinforcement of what people already know. 

您的内容应该既关注缺失的差距，也关注人们已经知道的内容的强化。

Good assessment of these gaps varies from organization to organization. As a rule of thumb, you can get an initial picture with these questions:

1. How well do you think people throughout the company could describe its business model?
2. Do you share with your employees the same information presented in the earnings call? How frequently do you share your company P&L? Where are they likely to get data about how your company stacks up against the competition?
3. Is everyone aware of the difficult challenges your company faces? Have you asked them their thoughts about how to meet those challenges? Do you have a disciplined process for disseminating information and discussing challenges?
4. What area of your business do you think your people know little to nothing about? Could you ask a leader in the domain to communicate with the team? Are there any other ways you could facilitate communication between the groups?
5. How well do you think your people understand who the customer is and what their needs and desires are? Do you regularly share customer research? Do you facilitate your team spending more time with your customers?
6. If you were going to hold an off-site, what is the most pressing issue you would want your people to learn about and debate? How could you provide the richest possible presentation of that information?
7. What existing meetings or forums could be used to carve out dedicated time for communicating more about the business context? Do you regularly review any such meetings to be sure they are still effective? Do you regularly review and audit internal communication? Do you set different agendas for different kinds of communication (weekly stand-up vs. All-hands)?

对这些差距的良好评估因组织而异。根据经验，您可以获得包含以下问题的初步图片：

1. 你认为整个公司的人对它的商业模式的描述有多好？
2. 您是否与您的员工分享收益电话会议中提供的相同信息？您多久分享一次您的公司损益表？他们可能从哪里获得有关贵公司如何与竞争对手抗衡的数据？
3. 每个人都知道贵公司面临的困难挑战吗？你有没有问过他们对如何应对这些挑战的想法？您是否有严格的流程来传播信息和讨论挑战？
4. 您认为您的员工对您业务的哪个领域知之甚少或一无所知？你能请一个领域的领导和团队沟通吗？有没有其他方法可以促进组之间的交流？
5. 您认为您的员工对客户是谁以及他们的需求和愿望的了解程度如何？您是否定期分享客户研究？您是否让您的团队花更多时间与客户相处？
6. 如果您打算在场外举行，您希望您的员工了解和讨论的最紧迫问题是什么？您如何提供最丰富的信息展示？
7. 可以使用哪些现有的会议或论坛来腾出专门的时间来就业务环境进行更多交流？您是否定期审查任何此类会议以确保它们仍然有效？您是否定期审查和审计内部沟通？您是否为不同类型的交流（每周站立与全体会议）设置了不同的议程？

**Find the Medium**

**寻找媒介**

Once you’ve identified the information gaps and developed the storylines, you need a way to distribute the information. This is particularly important because the firehose (medium) you choose eventually molds the content and, depending on its shape, the nature of the information changes.

一旦您确定了信息差距并制定了故事情节，您就需要一种分发信息的方法。这一点特别重要，因为您选择的消防水管（介质）最终会塑造内容，并且根据其形状，信息的性质会发生变化。

The basic assumption is: _cold media create spaces for cold messages_, _and hot media create spaces for hot messages._ In order to distribute high-resolution messages, you need to look for hot media. Specifically, you need to look for those which:

**1\. Push the envelope of high-resolution information**

基本假设是：_冷媒体为冷消息创建空间_，_热媒体为热消息创建空间。_为了分发高分辨率消息，您需要寻找热媒体。具体来说，您需要寻找那些：

**1\.突破高分辨率信息的极限**

Common wisdom sees written text as the status quo for high-resolution messages. Whether an important email, a new piece of documentation, a protocol update, a leadership message or a simple chat message, everything goes through written words.

常识将书面文本视为高分辨率消息的现状。无论是重要的电子邮件、新的文档、协议更新、领导信息还是简单的聊天信息，一切都以书面形式进行。

Written texts have the power to be read in any circumstance but they lack the ability to create an inner private world where you know people have your full attention. Audio messages on the other hand have the unique ability to recreate a personal environment: a private space, just for the two of you.

书面文本在任何情况下都有阅读的能力，但它们缺乏创造一个内心的私人世界的能力，在那里你知道人们会全神贯注。另一方面，音频消息具有重新创建个人环境的独特能力：私人空间，只为你们两个。

Since mobile phones and the internet put anybody in the world in our pocket, and headphones then completed the distance, asynchronous audio messages become a more effective way to communicate in high definition. Audio can be used not only for content that touches important issues and requires more personal intimacy, but also for more ordinary issues that without the para-verbal components could be misinterpreted.

由于手机和互联网将世界上的任何人放在我们的口袋里，然后耳机完成了距离，异步音频消息成为一种更有效的高清通信方式。音频不仅可以用于涉及重要问题和需要更多个人亲密关系的内容，还可以用于更普通的问题，如果没有副语言成分可能会被误解。

Moreover, the rise of streaming audio (music, podcasts, audiobooks, internet radio) has already made audio-first content a huge part of people’s daily habits. Having a way to distribute important messages through a direct voice to people’s heads is tremendous leverage, which today feels a bit underappreciated. Yet, very few organizations are capitalizing on this.

此外，流媒体音频（音乐、播客、有声读物、网络广播）的兴起已经使音频优先内容成为人们日常习惯的重要组成部分。有一种通过直接的声音向人们传达重要信息的方法是一种巨大的影响力，但今天感觉有点被低估了。然而，很少有组织利用这一点。

![Image to show how leadership can use media di better communicate internally](http://pulseasync.com/assets/email-internal-communication.png)

When looking to distribute high-resolution content, look for media that can let you go the extra mile.

在寻找分发高分辨率内容时，请寻找可以让您更加努力的媒体。

**2\. Privilege both speed and coverage of information** 

**2\.速度和信息覆盖范围的特权**

Speed is how fast a message is able to propagate throughout a system, and coverage is how many people that message is able to reach. You want to make sure people read your content in a timely manner (high speed), and at the same time, you want to make sure nobody is left behind (high coverage).

速度是消息在整个系统中传播的速度，覆盖率是消息能够到达的人数。您希望确保人们及时（高速）阅读您的内容，同时，您希望确保没有人掉队（高覆盖率）。

Real-time chat tools like Slack are designed to facilitate rapid information flow (high speed), but at the expense of a poor reach (low coverage). Email, on the other hand, acts in the exact opposite fashion.

像 Slack 这样的实时聊天工具旨在促进信息的快速流动（高速），但代价是覆盖率低（覆盖率低）。另一方面，电子邮件以完全相反的方式起作用。

![Image to show Slack vs Email and where the ideal solution is](http://pulseasync.com/assets/slack-vs-email-for-internal-communication.png)

When picking a medium, think carefully about the compromise (velocity vs coverage) you’re making.

选择媒体时，请仔细考虑您所做的妥协（速度与覆盖范围）。

**3\. Feature high signal/noise**

**3\。具有高信号/噪声**

Our attention and comprehension are where information “happens”. Avoid cluttered and overused media where information is already flowing in high-quantity. The chances of your message getting the right level of attention are very low.‍

我们的注意力和理解力是信息“发生”的地方。避免信息已经大量流动的混乱和过度使用的媒体。您的信息获得适当关注的可能性非常低。

**4\. Provide analytics**

**4. 提供分析**

Search for products that have built-in analytics. While this might sound obvious, most of them don’t have mechanisms in place to let you understand how fast/slow your message has been read or (most importantly) by how many people.

搜索具有内置分析功能的产品。虽然这听起来很明显，但它们中的大多数都没有适当的机制来让您了解您的消息被阅读的速度/速度或（最重要的是）有多少人阅读。

![Why feedback loops are fundamental to improve internal communication](http://pulseasync.com/assets/feedback-loop.png)

Specifically, look for media that provide:

1. Data about how people engage with your message (skimming vs. deep-read)
2. Data about how fast they receive the message (low vs. fast distribution)
3. Data about how many actually read your message (low vs. high coverage)
4. Aggregated data over time about how the organization is consuming content
5. Aggregated data over time about how the organization is producing content

具体来说，寻找提供以下内容的媒体：

1. 关于人们如何与您的信息互动的数据（略读与深度阅读）
2. 关于他们接收消息的速度的数据（低与快速分发）
3. 关于有多少人真正阅读了您的消息的数据（低覆盖率与高覆盖率）
4. 随着时间的推移，关于组织如何消费内容的汇总数据
5. 一段时间内关于组织如何制作内容的汇总数据

**Find the Rhythm**

**找到节奏**

At this point, you should bear in mind what type of content (messages) you need to talk about and how it’s going to be distributed (the medium).

在这一点上，您应该记住您需要谈论什么类型的内容（消息）以及它将如何分发（媒体）。

Those two aren’t enough if you don’t develop what I call a strong **heartbeat of communication**. Working out how to do this — and, for company leaders and HR executives, coaching all managers to do it consistently and continuously, takes a lot of time. Finding an organization pace, not only means finding a rhythm regarding the creation/distribution of information, but also letting people create personal habits of information consumption over time.

如果你不发展我所说的强大的**沟通的心跳**，这两个是不够的。弄清楚如何做到这一点——对于公司领导和人力资源主管来说，指导所有经理始终如一地做到这一点，需要大量时间。找到一个组织节奏，不仅意味着找到一个关于信息创建/分发的节奏，而且要让人们随着时间的推移形成个人信息消费习惯。

Establishing a strong heartbeat of communication starts with these two things:

**1\. You need an owner**

建立强大的沟通心跳从以下两件事开始：

**1\.你需要一个主人**

The owner establishes the pace and oversees its execution, making sure the entire company is following it regularly. Depending on the company size and its culture, this role may change considerably. In some organizations, the CEO directly handles important communication. In others, there’s a head of internal communication or Chief of Staff who acts as air traffic control for high-resolution communication.

所有者建立步伐并监督其执行，确保整个公司定期遵循它。根据公司规模和文化，这个角色可能会发生很大变化。在一些组织中，CEO 直接处理重要的沟通。在其他情况下，有内部通信负责人或参谋长，负责高分辨率通信的空中交通管制。

**2\. Find Directly Responsible Individuals (DRI)**

**2\.查找直接责任人 (DRI)**

From sales and customer service to product and engineering teams, each department should have a DRI responsible for delivering updates, keeping not just their own people, but the entire company up-to-date on what's going on in their team, as well as broader issues that everyone should be aware of.

从销售和客户服务到产品和工程团队，每个部门都应该有一个 DRI 负责提供更新，不仅让他们自己的员工，而且让整个公司了解他们团队以及更广泛的最新动态每个人都应该注意的问题。

The rhythm is such an essential detail because as both business and the context of the work to be done to keep changing, so should the messages. Pulling the same messages and showing them over and over is not effective. You’ve got to constantly monitor the messages and update them as soon as the circumstances change. A strong heartbeat ensures that the organization is always informed by the latest and most important information.

节奏是一个非常重要的细节，因为随着业务和要完成的工作的上下文不断变化，信息也应该如此。拉取相同的消息并一遍又一遍地显示它们是无效的。您必须不断监视消息并在情况发生变化时立即更新它们。强大的心跳确保组织始终了解最新和最重要的信息。

**Measure, measure, measure**

**测量，测量，测量**

How do you ensure things are constantly improving over time? You need a systematic way to measure what’s happening. That’s where you close the feedback loop. While it may sound obvious in retrospect, not many businesses are measuring how they’re communicating and how well their approach is working.

您如何确保事情随着时间的推移不断改进？您需要一种系统的方法来衡量正在发生的事情。这就是你关闭反馈循环的地方。虽然回想起来这听起来很明显，但并没有多少企业在衡量他们的沟通方式以及他们的方法的效果如何。

To understand what’s working and what’s not working, you need to get both:

\- _Qualitative feedback_: collect employee memos to precisely understand how things could be improved. 

要了解什么有效，什么无效，您需要同时获得：

\- _定性反馈_：收集员工备忘录以准确了解如何改进。

\- _Quantitative feedback_: measure data on how people interact with your messages; how many of them actually read it, how relevant the information is, how often do they check it etc.

\- _定量反馈_：衡量人们如何与您的消息互动的数据；他们中有多少人实际阅读过它，信息的相关性如何，他们多久检查一次等等。

**Create a Positive Feedback Loop**

**创建一个正反馈循环**

If you execute the above steps correctly you end up creating a positive feedback loop where the more you communicate, the better context you deliver to your team and the more people actually understand their impact and feel emotionally attached to the company and its mission.

如果你正确地执行上述步骤，你最终会创建一个积极的反馈循环，你沟通得越多，你为团队提供的环境就越好，更多的人真正了解他们的影响，并对公司及其使命产生情感上的依恋。

Loops are powerful because they aren’t one-shot initiatives, they compound over time, eventually turning your strengths into an actual competitive advantage.

循环很强大，因为它们不是一次性的举措，它们会随着时间的推移而复合，最终将您的优势转化为实际的竞争优势。

![Expanded feedback loop to show how you can improve internal communication](http://pulseasync.com/assets/feedback-loop-employees-engagement.png)

Truly empowering people to learn how your business works and what the broader context of their contributions is makes for the most valuable learning and the most effective form of “employee engagement”.

真正让人们了解您的企业如何运作，以及他们贡献的更广泛背景是什么，这有助于最有价值的学习和最有效的“员工参与”形式。

Not big HR initiatives or sponsored group activities, but simple, clear, continuous communication about the context of the work to be done is the first step in creating a high-output organization and retaining your best talents.

不是大的人力资源计划或赞助的小组活动，而是关于要完成的工作背景的简单、清晰、持续的沟通，是创建高产出组织和留住最佳人才的第一步。
