To all the people and businesses around the world who depend on us, we are sorry for the inconvenience caused by today’s outage across our platforms. We’ve been working as hard as we can to restore access, and our systems are now back up and running. The underlying cause of this outage also impacted many of the internal tools and systems we use in our day-to-day operations, complicating our attempts to quickly diagnose and resolve the problem.

对于世界各地依赖我们的所有人和企业，对于今天跨平台中断给我们带来的不便，我们深表歉意。我们一直在努力恢复访问权限，现在我们的系统已恢复正常运行。此次中断的根本原因还影响了我们在日常运营中使用的许多内部工具和系统，使我们快速诊断和解决问题的尝试变得复杂。

Our engineering teams have learned that configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers caused issues that interrupted this communication. This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt.

我们的工程团队了解到，协调数据中心之间网络流量的主干路由器上的配置更改会导致中断此通信的问题。这种网络流量中断对我们数据中心的通信方式产生了连锁影响，导致我们的服务停止。

Our services are now back online and we’re actively working to fully return them to regular operations. We want to make clear that there was no malicious activity behind this outage — its root cause was a faulty configuration change on our end. We also have no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime. _(Updated on Oct. 5, 2021, to reflect the latest information)_

我们的服务现已重新上线，我们正在积极努力使其完全恢复正常运营。我们要明确指出，这次中断背后没有恶意活动——其根本原因是我们端的错误配置更改。我们也没有证据表明用户数据因此次停机而受到损害。 _（2021 年 10 月 5 日更新，以反映最新信息）_

People and businesses around the world rely on us every day to stay connected. We understand the impact that outages like these have on people’s lives, as well as our responsibility to keep people informed about disruptions to our services. We apologize to all those affected, and we’re working to understand more about what happened today so we can continue to make our infrastructure more resilient. 

世界各地的人们和企业每天都依靠我们来保持联系。我们了解此类中断对人们生活的影响，以及我们有责任让人们了解我们的服务中断情况。我们向所有受影响的人道歉，我们正在努力了解更多关于今天发生的事情，以便我们能够继续使我们的基础设施更具弹性。
