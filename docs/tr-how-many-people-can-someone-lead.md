September 2, 2021


## The Short Answer

## 简短的回答

A common question I hear in my [technical leadership workshops](https://www.patkua.com/shortcut-to-tech-leadership/) is, “How many people can someone (eg a Tech Lead or Engineering Manager) lead ?”

我在 [技术领导力研讨会](https://www.patkua.com/shortcut-to-tech-leadership/)中听到的一个常见问题是，“一个人（例如技术主管或工程经理)可以领导多少人？ ？”

![img](https://www.patkua.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HowManyPeople-1024x512.png)What’s the magic number?

My answer is generally 5-7 people for an experienced leader, but many factors affect the final number. Some of these factors include their  leadership scope, other leadership roles, the experience level of the  leader, the experience level of the team, and the level of  organisational bureaucracy.

对于有经验的领导，我的回答一般是5-7人，但影响最终人数的因素很多。其中一些因素包括他们的领导范围、其他领导角色、领导者的经验水平、团队的经验水平以及组织官僚主义的水平。

## The Longer Answer

## 更长的答案

Let’s look at each of these factors and how they might affect someone’s ability to lead.

让我们来看看这些因素中的每一个，以及它们如何影响某人的领导能力。

### Leadership Scope

### 领导范围

A leader’s scope will influence the number of people they can lead. The broader their responsibilities, the less time they have to lead  effectively. For example, a typical [Tech Lead Engineering Manager (Tech Lead EM)](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_1_The_Tech_Lead_EM) archetype has a broader scope than a typical [Team Lead Engineer Manager (Team Lead EM)](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_2_The_Team_Lead_EM) archetype. The Tech Lead EM role needs to spend more time on technical  topics such as guiding architecture decisions, spotting technically  risky implementations, or negotiating with security and other technical  teams to agree on interfaces and processes. The Tech Lead EM has less  time to take care of people, team and process or delivery  responsibilities. Many Tech Lead EMs often prioritise the technical work (e.g. choosing frameworks, libraries and design or architecture  choices) over people or team responsibilities to their team’s detriment. On the other hand, a typical Team Lead EM is less involved in technical discussions, giving them more time to focus on building a  high-performing team and the line management responsibilities. They can  spend this additional time investing in their people through regular  feedback, holding more effective 1-1s on a weekly basis, helping people  grow and looking at optimising how everyone works together as a team.

领导者的范围将影响他们可以领导的人数。他们的职责越广泛，他们有效领导的时间就越少。例如，典型的[Tech Lead Engineering Manager (Tech Lead EM)](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_1_The_Tech_Lead_EM)原型比典型的[Team首席工程师经理（Team Lead EM）](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_2_The_Team_Lead_EM)原型。技术主管 EM 角色需要在技术主题上花费更多时间，例如指导架构决策、发现技术风险实施或与安全和其他技术团队谈判以就接口和流程达成一致。技术主管 EM 用于处理人员、团队和流程或交付职责的时间较少。许多技术主管 EM 经常优先考虑技术工作（例如选择框架、库和设计或架构选择)而不是人员或团队责任，这对他们的团队不利。另一方面，典型的团队负责人 EM 较少参与技术讨论，让他们有更多时间专注于建立高绩效团队和直线管理职责。他们可以利用这些额外的时间通过定期反馈来投资于他们的员工，每周举行更有效的 1-1，帮助人们成长并着眼于优化每个人作为一个团队的合作方式。

### Other Leadership Roles

### 其他领导角色

In a typical cross-functional software team, a leader’s role is  influenced by other leadership roles in that team. For example, a team  with only a single leader requires that leader to shoulder all  responsibility. This might range from planning, technical decision  making, people and team management responsibilities. In my experience,  an experienced leader in this situation can lead a maximum of 3-4 team  members in this team configuration because they have so many  responsibilities.

在典型的跨职能软件团队中，领导者的角色会受到该团队中其他领导角色的影响。例如，只有一个领导者的团队要求该领导者承担所有责任。这可能包括规划、技术决策、人员和团队管理职责。以我的经验，在这种情况下，一个经验丰富的领导者最多可以领导 3-4 名团队成员，因为他们有太多的责任。

![img](https://www.patkua.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SingleVsSplitRoles-1024x512.png)The effect of splitting responsibilities across different leadership roles

Organisations can increase the number of people if they split  leadership responsibilities across different roles, with different  people leading different areas. Consider a common Product Manager (PM),  Tech Lead (TL) and Engineering Manager (EM) leadership combination. In  this type of team, the PM leads the product planning, working with  internal/external stakeholders, prioritising the next set of outcomes,  and all launch activities. The TL in this team leads the technically  focused topics such as aligning technical decisions in the team,  steering architecturally significant decisions, managing technical  stakeholders (e.g. ops and security) and writing and reviewing code. An  EM in this type of team typically looks like the [Team Lead EM](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_2_The_Team_Lead_EM) or [Delivery EM](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_3_The_Delivery_EM), focused on optimising the flow of work throughout the team and people and team management.

如果组织将领导职责划分为不同的角色，让不同的人领导不同的领域，则可以增加人数。考虑一个常见的产品经理 (PM)、技术主管 (TL) 和工程经理 (EM) 领导组合。在这种类型的团队中，PM 领导产品规划，与内部/外部利益相关者合作，确定下一组结果的优先级，以及所有发布活动。该团队中的 TL 领导以技术为重点的主题，例如调整团队中的技术决策、指导架构上重要的决策、管理技术利益相关者（例如运营和安全）以及编写和审查代码。这类团队中的 EM 通常看起来像 [Team Lead EM](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_2_The_Team_Lead_EM) 或 [交付 EM](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes/#Archetype_3_The_Delivery_EM)，专注于优化整个团队以及人员和团队管理的工作流程。

A team with additional leadership roles gives each person more time  to focus on leading their area but requires more synchronisation between the roles. With experienced people in each position, the “leadership  group” can lead a bigger overall group (e.g. 7-10).

具有额外领导角色的团队让每个人有更多时间专注于领导他们的领域，但需要角色之间更多的同步。每个职位都有经验丰富的人，“领导小组”可以领导更大的整体团队（例如 7-10）。

### Experience Level of the Leader

### 领导者的经验水平

The greater and the broader the leader’s experience, the more people  they can lead. Consider two teams, one with a first-time leader and the  second who has been leading teams for 5+ years.

领导者的经验越丰富、范围越广，他们可以领导的人就越多。考虑两个团队，一个是第一次领导，另一个是领导团队 5 年以上。

A first-time leader is going to be doing a lot of learning on the  job. A first-time leadership role requires a significant shift in  skills, some of which the person playing that role haven’t yet  developed. As an example, a common transition of a developer to an [Engineering Manager](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes) means they should be giving regular feedback (ie a learnable skill) ,  but, likely, they never spent time as a developer learning how to  provide effective feedback. A less experienced leader spends more time  on the same leadership activities as they have to follow up more, deal  with any confusion they caused and explore alternative approaches that  work for different people in their team. For less-experienced leaders,  aim for a smaller team (i.e. 2-3) because they will need more time to  grow leadership skills they haven’t necessarily mastered.

第一次担任领导者将在工作中进行大量学习。第一次担任领导角色需要技能的重大转变，其中一些技能的扮演者尚未发展。例如，开发人员通常过渡到 [工程经理](https://www.patkua.com/blog/5-engineering-manager-archetypes) 意味着他们应该定期提供反馈（即可学习的技能） ，但是，很可能，作为开发人员，他们从未花时间学习如何提供有效的反馈。经验不足的领导者会在相同的领导活动上花费更多时间，因为他们必须进行更多跟进，处理他们造成的任何混乱，并探索适用于团队中不同人员的替代方法。对于经验不足的领导者，目标是建立一个较小的团队（即 2-3 人)，因为他们需要更多时间来培养他们不一定掌握的领导技能。

Now imagine a seasoned leader who has been working across many teams  in many different organisations over five years. They have built a  robust set of leadership skills and grown their toolkit to deal with  various people and team situations. This experience allows them to lead a larger team (e.g. 4-5) more effectively. With more experience, this  sort of leader can anticipate risk earlier, communicate clearer and they spend less time fulfilling their leadership duties.

现在想象一下一位经验丰富的领导者，他在许多不同组织的许多团队中工作了五年。他们已经建立了一套强大的领导技能，并发展了他们的工具包来处理各种人员和团队情况。这种经验使他们能够更有效地领导更大的团队（例如 4-5 人）。有了更多的经验，这种类型的领导者可以更早地预测风险，更清晰地沟通，并且他们花更少的时间来完成他们的领导职责。

### Experience Level of the Team

### 团队的经验水平

The experience level of team members also affects how many people a  leader can lead. As an example, many startup companies attract younger  and less experienced team members because they cost less. Some of these  people might be in their first or second job. A leader leading a less  experienced team typically adopts a more directive leadership style. They need to spend more time teaching, mentoring and coaching. They need to spend more time driving technical conversations and reviewing  designs and code to manage risk. 

团队成员的经验水平也会影响领导者可以领导的人数。例如，许多初创公司吸引年轻且经验不足的团队成员，因为他们的成本较低。其中一些人可能在做第一份或第二份工作。领导经验不足的团队的领导者通常采用更直接的领导风格。他们需要花更多的时间进行教学、指导和辅导。他们需要花更多时间推动技术对话并审查设计和代码以管理风险。

Compare this type of team with a leader working with very seasoned  and experienced team members (e.g. each with 10+ years of building  software). In a more experienced team, the leader adapts their  leadership style to be more facilitative and supportive than directive. The leader can rely more on the collective experience. The leader can  and should delegate more complex or risky topics instead of needing to  actively drive conversations. A more experienced team can spot risks  earlier and deal with them without a leader pointing them out. A less  experienced team suffers from the “unknown unknowns”, which means a  leader needs to worry and manage risk more.

将这种类型的团队与与经验丰富且经验丰富的团队成员（例如，每个成员都有 10 多年的软件开发经验）一起工作的领导者进行比较。在更有经验的团队中，领导者会调整他们的领导风格，使其更具促进性和支持性，而非指令性。领导者可以更多地依赖集体经验。领导者可以而且应该委派更复杂或有风险的话题，而不是需要积极推动对话。更有经验的团队可以更早地发现风险并在没有领导者指出的情况下处理它们。经验不足的团队会遭受“未知的未知数”的困扰，这意味着领导者需要更多地担心和管理风险。

A more experienced team doesn’t guarantee a leader can lead a bigger group, but it certainly helps.

一个更有经验的团队并不能保证一个领导者可以领导一个更大的团队，但它肯定会有所帮助。

### **Level of Organisational Bureaucracy**

### **组织官僚机构的级别**

One final factor that affects a leader’s ability is the level of  organisational bureaucracy. High levels of bureaucracy take time away  from the leader to deal with tasks and activities outside of the team.

影响领导者能力的最后一个因素是组织官僚主义的水平。高水平的官僚主义会占用领导者的时间来处理团队之外的任务和活动。

For example, I worked with one client in the pre-cloud days, and we  wanted a new server for continuous integration. To obtain a new server,  we needed to fill out several physical forms, each demanding a review  and approval of several managers. This process existed so someone could  determine if there was enough compute capacity, and if not, ensure there was enough lead time to buy and set up the hardware. I spent about *four elapsed weeks* and an estimated *four full days of effort*. I spent this time meeting people to uncover the process, fill out the  paperwork, determine where my request was, and influence people to get  approval. Compare this with a more modern company today that provides a  self-service platform where teams can instantly set up new cloud-based  servers with a single click!

例如，我在云之前的日子里与一个客户合作，我们想要一个新的服务器来进行持续集成。为了获得一台新服务器，我们需要填写几张实物表格，每张表格都需要经过几位经理的审查和批准。存在此过程，以便有人可以确定是否有足够的计算能力，如果没有，则确保有足够的准备时间来购买和设置硬件。我花了大约*四个星期*和估计*四整天的努力*。我花了这段时间与人们会面以了解流程，填写文书工作，确定我的请求在哪里，并影响人们获得批准。将其与今天提供自助服务平台的更现代的公司进行比较，团队可以通过单击立即设置新的基于云的服务器！

![img](https://www.patkua.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TimeOnBureaucracy-1024x512.png)More bureaucracy decreases the available time leaders have to spend with their teams

Organisational bureaucracy comes in many forms, but a leader must navigate all of these. Other examples might include:

组织官僚主义有多种形式，但领导者必须驾驭所有这些形式。其他示例可能包括：

- Planning processes (e.g. quarterly planning, setting up OKRs)
- Line management (e.g. holiday, travel or expense reimbursements)
- Chasing dependencies (e.g. following up with another team to make sure a  critical dependency is planned or agreeing on an API or test environment from an external vendor)
- Discovery work (e.g. Finding what you need to do or who you need to get approval for a new tool)

- 计划流程（例如季度计划、设置 OKR）
- 线路管理（例如假期、旅行或费用报销）
- 追踪依赖关系（例如，跟进另一个团队以确保关键依赖关系得到规划或同意来自外部供应商的 API 或测试环境）
- 发现工作（例如，寻找您需要做的事情或您需要谁来获得新工具的批准）

The more time a leader spends on bureaucracy, the less time they have to lead their team. In high bureaucracy organisations, leaders can only effectively lead a smaller group than those working in a  lower-bureaucracy one.

领导者花在官僚主义上的时间越多，他们领导团队的时间就越少。在高官僚机构中，与在低官僚机构中工作的领导者相比，领导者只能有效地领导一个更小的团队。

## It All Depends

## 这一切都取决于

Like with most things in software, especially when people are  involved, there is no easy answer. While I generally use a rule of thumb of 5-7 people, you can see it all depends. More importantly, you can  also see some of the factors on why it depends so that you can answer,  for your context, “How many people can someone lead?”

就像软件中的大多数事情一样，尤其是当有人参与时，没有简单的答案。虽然我通常使用 5-7 人的经验法则，但您可以看到这一切都取决于。更重要的是，您还可以了解其依赖原因的一些因素，以便您可以根据自己的情况回答“一个人可以领导多少人？”
