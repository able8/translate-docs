It’s toxic and wrecks productivity.

它是有毒的，会破坏生产力。

Summary.
At home and at work, busy culture worsens the problems it promises to solve. We think that the busier we are, the bigger impact we’ll be able to make. But in reality, busy culture destroys productivity, while pulling us away from our families and coworkers alike. What can leaders do to dismantle a toxic culture of busyness? In this piece, the author shares three strategies to encourage healthier work-life boundaries, including instituting financial incentives for disconnecting from work, modeling focus on your primary goal, and leaning on peers within the organization to support a more positive company culture.

概括。
在家庭和工作中，忙碌的文化会使它承诺要解决的问题变得更糟。我们认为我们越忙，我们能够产生的影响就越大。但实际上，忙碌的文化会破坏生产力，同时让我们远离家人和同事。领导者可以做些什么来消除忙碌的有毒文化？在这篇文章中，作者分享了三种鼓励更健康的工作与生活界限的策略，包括为与工作脱节而制定财务激励措施、将重点放在您的主要目标上，以及依靠组织内的同事来支持更积极的公司文化。

At home and at work, “busy” culture worsens the problems it promises to solve. It's natural to assume that the busier we are, the bigger the impact we'll be able to make — but in reality, studies have shown that busy culture [destroys productivity](http://hbr.org/2019/04/preventing-busyness-from-becoming-burnout) and pulls us away from both our families and deeper relationships with our coworkers.

在家庭和工作中，“忙碌”的文化会使它承诺要解决的问题变得更糟。很自然地假设我们越忙，我们能够产生的影响就越大——但实际上，研究表明，忙碌的文化[破坏生产力](http://hbr.org/2019/04/preventing-忙于成为职业倦怠)并使我们远离家人和与同事的更深层次的关系。

Like all work cultures, busy culture starts at the top, with leaders who want to appear successful, important, and productive. But what makes it so tough to overcome is that it also has roots at the bottom, where junior employees compete to stand out as hard workers eager to contribute and move up.

与所有工作文化一样，忙碌的文化始于高层，领导者希望显得成功、重要和富有成效。但它之所以如此难以克服，是因为它也扎根于底层，初级员工在那里竞争成为渴望做出贡献并向上移动的努力工作者。

And then, of course, there’s the problem of how porous our work-life boundaries have become, thanks to the proliferation of technologies that make it possible to work and connect with one another from anywhere, at any time.

然后，当然，还有一个问题是我们的工作与生活的界限变得多么松散，这要归功于技术的激增，这些技术使得随时随地工作和相互联系成为可能。

So what can leaders do to combat a toxic culture of busyness? There’s no easy answer, but here are three strategies that can help:

那么，领导者可以做些什么来对抗忙碌的有毒文化呢？没有简单的答案，但这里有三个可以提供帮助的策略：

**Incentivize boundary-setting.** Busy culture has to be fought with unquestionable company commitment. Praising employees and awarding them extra time off is a good start, but those measures can often come across as token gestures. What works better, it turns out, is _paying_ people to be less busy.

**激励边界设置。** 必须以公司无可置疑的承诺与忙碌的文化作斗争。表扬员工并给予他们额外的休假是一个好的开始，但这些措施通常会被视为象征性的姿态。事实证明，更好的做法是_支付_人们不那么忙碌。

That may sound radical, but paying people to work less is an appropriate solution for what has become a serious problem. [More than four-fifths](https://techtalk.gfi.com/survey-81-of-us-employees-check-their-work-mail-outside-work-hours/) of employees send work emails on weekends . Nearly six in 10 do so while on vacation, and more than half check email after 11 PM.

这听起来可能有些激进，但付钱让人们少工作是解决已成为严重问题的适当解决方案。 [超过五分之四](https://techtalk.gfi.com/survey-81-of-us-employees-check-their-work-mail-outside-work-hours/) 的员工在周末发送工作电子邮件.近十分之六的人在度假时这样做，超过一半的人会在晚上 11 点后查看电子邮件。

These are problematic behaviors if you’re worried about the health, satisfaction, and productivity of your employees. The good news is, they’re also behaviors that managers can easily track and use to promote boundary-setting.

如果您担心员工的健康、满意度和生产力，这些都是有问题的行为。好消息是，它们也是管理者可以轻松跟踪和用于促进边界设置的行为。

[One tech company](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-this-tech-ceo-gives-employees-7500-to-go-on-vacation-2015-6), FullContact, has been doing this for years. Employees can earn a $7,500 annual vacation stipend by following three simple rules: No checking work messages, no working, and no staying home (although recently, staycations have also qualified). Referred to internally as a “paid, paid vacation,” the stipend is enforced through a combination of vacation photo-sharing, communication channel monitoring, and self-reporting. 

[一家科技公司](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-this-tech-ceo-gives-employees-7500-to-go-on-vacation-2015-6)，FullContact，一直在这样做年。员工可以通过遵循三个简单的规则获得 7,500 美元的年休假津贴：不查看工作消息、不工作和不呆在家里（尽管最近，staycations 也有资格)。在内部称为“带薪带薪假期”，津贴通过假期照片共享、沟通渠道监控和自我报告的组合来执行。

A few years after launching the program, the company's communications director, Brad McCarty, [told the](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2014/10/23/no-vacation-nation-one-company-gives-workers-7500-to-unplug-and-get-away/) [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2014/10/23/no-vacation-nation-one-company-gives-workers-7500-to-unplug-and-get-away/) that the program was working “incredibly well,” adding that when employees returned from these vacations they were “shining brighter, working harder , and more excited to get back into the swing of things.”

该计划启动几年后，该公司的通讯总监 Brad McCarty [告诉](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2014/10/23/no-vacation-nation-one-company-gives-workers-7500-to-unplug-and-get-away/) [_华盛顿邮报_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2014/10/23/no-vacation-nation-one-company-gives-workers-7500-to-unplug-and-get-away/) 表示该计划运行“非常好”，并补充说，当员工从这些假期回来时，他们“更加闪亮，工作更加努力” ，并且更兴奋地重新回到事物的摇摆中。”

Another popular approach is to structure vacations as paid sabbaticals. In 2011, [just 4%](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/1211tyler.aspx) of employers offered paid sabbaticals. By 2017, [more than four times as many](http://hbr.org/2017/08/research-shows-that-organizations-benefit-when-employees-take-sabbaticals#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20survey%20from,17%25%20of%20employers%20in%202017.) employers did.

另一种流行的方法是将假期安排为带薪休假。 2011 年，[仅 4%](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/1211tyler.aspx) 的雇主提供带薪休假。到 2017 年，[超过四倍](http://hbr.org/2017/08/research-shows-that-organizations-benefit-when-employees-take-sabbaticals#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20survey%20from,17%25%20of%20employers%20in%202017。)雇主做到了。

Because unused sabbatical time [doesn't have to be paid out](https://www.thelelawblog.com/2011/08/articles/fmla-and-other-leaves-of-absence/employers-beware-vacation-v-sabbatical-leaves/#:~:text=The%20difference%20is%20important%3A%20Vacation,whereas%2C%20sabbatical%20leave%20does%20not.) when the term of employment ends, companies are able to offer more generous policies if they treat that time as a sabbatical rather than a vacation. In addition, especially in the academic sphere, sabbaticals are a culturally accepted way to take time for personal development not directly related to work. Reframing vacations as sabbaticals may help employees feel less stigma around taking time off.

因为未使用的休假时间[不必支付](https://www.thelelawblog.com/2011/08/articles/fmla-and-other-leaves-of-absence/employers-beware-vacation-v-sabbatical-leaves/#:~:text=The%20difference%20is%20important%3A%20Vacation，而%2C%20sabbatical%20leave%20does%20not。)当雇佣期结束时，公司能够提供更慷慨的如果他们将那段时间视为休假而不是假期，则可以制定政策。此外，特别是在学术领域，休假是一种文化上可接受的方式，用于与工作没有直接关系的个人发展。将假期重新定义为休假可能会帮助员工减少对休假的耻辱感。

**Focus on your core contribution.** Countering busy culture means saying “no” to tasks that don’t align with your primary duties — and leaders have to set that example. Until the rest of your team sees you saying “no” to secondary duties, they won’t feel comfortable doing so either.

**专注于你的核心贡献。**对抗忙碌的文化意味着对与你的主要职责不符的任务说“不”——领导者必须树立榜样。在您团队的其他成员看到您对次要职责说“不”之前，他们也不会觉得这样做很舒服。

Do you enjoy downtime when you get it, or do you fill it with less-than-critical work? Do you abandon side projects — which are only useful insofar as they serve your core focus — early and often? Does everybody you work with know what your primary duties are? Even employees you don’t work directly with should know what those duties are and recognize your commitment to them.

当你得到它时，你喜欢停机时间，还是用不太重要的工作来填补它？您是否会尽早并经常放弃副项目——这些项目只有在服务于您的核心焦点时才有用？与您共事的每个人都知道您的主要职责是什么吗？即使您不直接与之共事的员工也应该知道这些职责是什么，并承认您对这些职责的承诺。

On this front, too, a radical approach is often the most effective. In his book [_Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_](https://gregmckeown.com/book/), the leadership strategist Greg McKeown argues that to combat busy culture and create a healthier and more productive work environment, leaders should say “ yes” to only the top 10% of the tasks presented to them. Show through your actions that your core duties are your priority, and make saying “no” to other work the norm.

在这方面，激进的方法通常也是最有效的。领导力战略家 Greg McKeown 在他的著作 [_Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_](https://gregmckeown.com/book/) 中认为，要对抗忙碌的文化并创造一个更健康、更高效的工作环境，领导者应该说“是”，仅对提交给他们的任务的前 10% 表示同意。通过你的行动表明你的核心职责是你的首要任务，并对其他工作说“不”成为常态。

That's the approach that the co-founder of CD Baby, Derek Sivers, [has adopted](https://tim.blog/2018/06/20/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-derek-sivers-distilled/). “If it’s not a ‘hell, yeah,’” he says, “it’s a ‘no.’” Sivers understands that it’s not bad opportunities that can kill his business but mediocre ones.

这就是 CD Baby 的联合创始人 Derek Sivers 采用的方法。 “如果这不是‘地狱，是的’，”他说，“那就是‘不’。”西弗斯明白，可以扼杀他的生意的不是坏机会，而是平庸的机会。

**Lean on lateral and external influencers.** Culture is built informally, interaction by interaction. But no single individual can change the culture of a large organization alone. What works to effect change is [positive peer pressure](http://hbr.org/2010/04/positive-peer-pressure-a-power), exerted by social connections rather than top-down directives. 

**依靠横向和外部影响者。** 文化是非正式建立的，互动互动。但没有一个人可以单独改变大型组织的文化。影响改变的是[积极的同伴压力](http://hbr.org/2010/04/positive-peer-pressure-a-power)，它是由社会关系而非自上而下的指令施加的。

Consider how Ben & Jerry’s finally got workers to use its nap rooms. At first, people were so embarrassed about using them that they would use phony names like “Donald Duck” on the signup sheet. After removing the signup sheet, Ben & Jerry's realized a simpler system could still show everyone that the rooms were being used without revealing individual users' identities: “If the door is closed,” [a spokesperson explained](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/30/success/companies-nap/index.html), “you know it is being used.” Although rooms can no longer be booked in advance, Ben & Jerry’s realized the higher priority was making everyone feel comfortable using them in the first place.

想想 Ben & Jerry's 是如何最终让员工使用它的午睡室的。起初，人们对使用它们感到非常尴尬，以至于他们会在注册表上使用诸如“唐老鸭”之类的假名。移除登记表后，Ben & Jerry's 意识到一个更简单的系统仍然可以向所有人显示房间正在被使用，而无需透露个人用户的身份：“如果门是关着的，”[一位发言人解释说](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/30/success/companies-nap/index.html)，“你知道它正在被使用。”尽管不能再提前预订房间，但 Ben & Jerry's 意识到首先要让每个人都感到舒适使用它们。

Similarly, the founder of Gabb Wireless, Stephen Dalby, who I met while working in the nonprofit world, struggled to put his phone down after work until his 6-year-old son asked [a cutting question](https://gabbwireless.com/welcome-to-gabb/): “Daddy, can we play a game — or is your phone too important?” Despite founding Gabb to help young people spend less time on screens, Stephen struggled to turn off “business mode.” To combat this culture in himself and his team, he encouraged employees to establish small, daily traditions like device-free dinners — and he talked about those dinners at work, reminding his people that healthy boundary-setting was the norm.

同样，我在非营利组织工作时认识的 Gabb Wireless 创始人 Stephen Dalby 下班后一直在努力放下手机，直到他 6 岁的儿子提出了[一个尖锐的问题](https://gabbwireless。com/welcome-to-gabb/)：“爸爸，我们可以玩个游戏吗——还是你的手机太重要了？”尽管创立 Gabb 是为了帮助年轻人减少在屏幕上的时间，但斯蒂芬还是努力关闭“商业模式”。为了在他自己和他的团队中与这种文化作斗争，他鼓励员工建立小型的日常传统，比如无设备晚餐——他谈到了工作中的那些晚餐，提醒他的员工，健康的界限设定是常态。

All companies get busy. The trick is to keep that busyness from becoming chronic and cultural, because when that happens, it also becomes corrosive — no matter how productive or positive it may seem.

所有的公司都很忙。诀窍是防止这种忙碌变成长期的和文化的，因为当这种情况发生时，它也会变得具有腐蚀性——无论它看起来多么富有成效或积极。
