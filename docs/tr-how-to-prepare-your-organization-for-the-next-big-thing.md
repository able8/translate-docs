The only constant is change. If the last 12 months have taught us anything, it’s how to adapt and adjust to change. We changed the way we work, the way students learn, and the way we stay connected with friends and family. I often hear people talk about wanting things to return to normal. Instead of craving a return to the way things were, I propose embracing change and developing strategies to tackle the next change thrown your way.

唯一不变的就是变化。如果说过去 12 个月教会了我们什么，那就是如何适应和适应变化。我们改变了我们的工作方式、学生学习的方式以及我们与朋友和家人保持联系的方式。我经常听到人们谈论希望事情恢复正常。与其渴望回到原来的样子，我建议拥抱变化并制定策略来应对下一个以您的方式抛出的变化。

Working in tech, things are constantly changing. New technology is released, we learn new ways of doing things, we develop new features for our applications, or implement new development processes like feature management. In this article, we’ll talk about some of the reasons we run from change, and how we can alter our perspective to open the door to it in a positive way that can have massive implications for our organizations.

在技术领域工作，事情总是在不断变化。新技术发布，我们学习新的做事方式，我们为我们的应用程序开发新功能，或实施新的开发流程，如功能管理。在本文中，我们将讨论我们逃避变革的一些原因，以及我们如何改变我们的观点，以积极的方式打开变革之门，从而对我们的组织产生巨大影响。

## Why do we avoid change?

## 为什么我们要避免改变？

**Change is overwhelming**

**变化是压倒性的**

In tech, there is a constantly-shifting landscape of tools, solutions, or frameworks. This can be overwhelming. If you’re looking for a new tool or solution, you can run into analysis paralysis as you survey all the choices. For example, take a look at [this landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) from the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/). If you’re thinking about changing your architecture, a landscape like this leads you to think, “I have no idea where to start, this will be too much work. I’ll just stick with what we’re doing now.”

在技术领域，工具、解决方案或框架的格局在不断变化。这可能是压倒性的。如果您正在寻找新的工具或解决方案，您可能会在调查所有选择时遇到分析瘫痪。例如，查看来自 [云原生计算基金会 (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) 的 [此景观](https://landscape.cncf.io/)。如果你正在考虑改变你的建筑，像这样的景观会让你想，“我不知道从哪里开始，这将是太多的工作。我会坚持我们现在正在做的事情。”

**Gatekeeping**

**看门**

In her talk at [All Day DevOps](https://www.alldaydevops.com/) in 2020, [Kat Cosgrove](https://www.alldaydevops.com/addo-speakers/kat-cosgrove) discussed how gatekeeping is used to avoid change. You suggest a change, and then it is shot down with a “that’s not how we do things here.” If you hear that enough, you stop suggesting changes.

在 2020 年 [All Day DevOps](https://www.alldaydevops.com/) 的演讲中，[Kat Cosgrove](https://www.alldaydevops.com/addo-speakers/kat-cosgrove) 讨论了守门用于避免更改。你建议改变，然后它被拒绝了，“这不是我们在这里做事的方式”。如果您听够了，就不再建议更改。

**Fear of failing**

**害怕失败**

Sometimes, when a change is proposed or implemented it doesn’t go as expected. Things fail. What happens after that failure can indicate whether somebody is willing to take a risk again. We live in a culture where failures are seen as a negative as opposed to viewing them as [learning opportunities](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/5-ways-lean-into-failure). Instead of being viewed as a failure, we play it safe and stick with what we know.

有时，当提议或实施更改时，它不会按预期进行。事情失败。失败之后发生的事情可以表明是否有人愿意再次冒险。我们生活在一种文化中，失败被视为消极因素，而不是将其视为 [学习机会](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/5-ways-lean-into-failure)。我们不会被视为失败，而是谨慎行事并坚持我们所知道的。

## Embrace change with these skills

## 用这些技能拥抱变化

Switching to a mindset where you’re willing to take on a change isn’t as easy as flipping a switch for a feature flag. After all, this way of operating has been drilled into you over years. Below are some skills you can work on to get ready to take a chance.

切换到愿意接受改变的心态并不像切换功能标志那么容易。毕竟，这种操作方式已经在您身上进行了多年。以下是一些您可以练习的技能，以便为抓住机会做好准备。

### Growth vs fixed mindset

### 成长与固定心态

We've [written and talked](https://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/to-get-ahead-in-tech-treat-soft-skills-like-technical-skills-/d/d-id/1331363) a lot about a growth vs a fixed mindset. And we’ll mention it again here. Having the right mindset is necessary for change to happen. With a fixed mindset, you believe that skills are innate; you either have it or you don’t; no amount of practice will improve or change things. People with a growth mindset believe that skills can be learned. Through hard work and practice you can achieve your goals.

我们已经[写作和谈话](https://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/to-get-ahead-in-tech-treat-soft-skills-like-technical-skills-/d/d-id/1331363)很多关于成长与固定心态。我们将在这里再次提及。拥有正确的心态是改变发生的必要条件。拥有固定型思维模式，你相信技能是与生俱来的；你要么拥有，要么没有；再多的练习也无法改善或改变事情。具有成长心态的人相信技能是可以学习的。通过努力工作和实践，您可以实现自己的目标。

People with a growth mindset are more likely to keep trying after they’ve failed or made a mistake. It’s not a reflection of who they are as a person. Rather, it is an opportunity to try and improve. With a growth mindset you’re more willing to look at change, and at times, failure, as an adventure as opposed to something scary.

成长型思维模式的人在失败或犯错后更有可能继续尝试。这不是他们作为一个人的反映。相反，这是一个尝试和改进的机会。有了成长心态，你更愿意将改变，有时甚至是失败，看作是一种冒险，而不是可怕的事情。

### Don’t worry about following best practices 

### 不要担心遵循最佳实践

One of the first things people do when researching a new tool, process, or framework is to look up examples or best practices. The problem with this—there is no such thing as a best practice. They are recommended or suggested. They work for a specific company with a specific group of people at a specific time. There are always ways to improve upon these practices. Don’t view best practices as things that are carved in stone and not capable of being changed or modified. View best practices as a starting point with a need for further iterations.

人们在研究新工具、流程或框架时做的第一件事就是查找示例或最佳实践。问题在于——没有最佳实践之类的东西。他们被推荐或建议。他们在特定时间为特定公司和特定人群工作。总有办法改进这些做法。不要将最佳实践视为刻在石头上且无法更改或修改的东西。将最佳实践视为需要进一步迭代的起点。

Best practices can sometimes lead to the “echo chamber” effect or simply put, a fixed mindset. If we do A then B will surely follow. This echo-chamber effect leads one to believe in truths that may not be there. When it comes to feature flagging and life in general, always check and verify. Take those suggestions and make the necessary changes to make it work for you. Improving on these practices is the growth mindset in full effect.

最佳实践有时会导致“回声室”效应，或者简单地说，是一种固定的心态。如果我们做A，那么B肯定会跟随。这种回声室效应使人们相信可能不存在的真理。当涉及到功能标记和一般生活时，请始终检查和验证。采纳这些建议并进行必要的更改以使其适合您。改进这些做法是充分发挥成长心态的作用。

### Remove fear from decision making

### 消除决策中的恐惧

Imagine two companies in the travel and entertainment industry that have drastic revenue losses due to Covid. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll refer to them as Company A and Company B.

想象一下旅游和娱乐行业的两家公司由于 Covid 的收入损失惨重。为简单起见，我们将它们称为 A 公司和 B 公司。

Company A lays off a third of their organization, divests various businesses and cancels 80% of their vendor contracts. The hope here is to regain budget through drastic measures and put that money towards the two remaining revenue-generating businesses.

A 公司裁员三分之一，剥离各种业务并取消 80% 的供应商合同。这里的希望是通过严厉措施重新获得预算，并将这笔钱用于剩下的两个创收业务。

Result? The work or goals in place are scrutinized heavily. Due to this scrutiny, and lack of psychological safety, mistakes are made and more jobs are lost. All of this was due to fear. Fear consumed these decisions that only worsened an already bad situation. This approach is a common tactic and [recent research](https://hbr-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/hbr.org/amp/2017/04/if-you-think-downsizing-might-save-your-company-think-again) reveals that Company A's experience isn't all that abnormal. Downsizing may have negative consequences.

结果？对现有的工作或目标进行严格审查。由于这种审查以及缺乏心理安全感，人们会犯错误并失去更多工作。这一切都是因为恐惧。恐惧消耗了这些决定，只会使已经很糟糕的情况变得更糟。这种方法是一种常见的策略和[最近的研究](https://hbr-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/hbr.org/amp/2017/04/if-you-think-downsizing-might-save-your-company-think-again)揭示了 A 公司的经历并不是那么不正常。缩小规模可能会产生负面影响。

Company B decides that despite the rapid decline in revenues due to Covid, they want to shift gears and adapt to the new “normal.” They reprioritize budgets, invest in technology to digitize and transform their company. They pull forward as many formerly future digitization initiatives as possible.

B 公司决定，尽管 Covid 导致收入迅速下降，但他们希望换档并适应新的“常态”。他们重新确定预算的优先级，投资于技术以实现公司的数字化和转型。他们尽可能多地推进以前的未来数字化计划。

Result? Even though Company B’s fears of losing more of their existing client base came true, their investments in creating a new technology platform opened the doors to an entirely different client base. This slowly increased overall revenues and profits for the company. Instead of letting fear drive the business, they let creativity and a growth mindset lead the way.

结果？尽管 B 公司担心失去更多现有客户群的担忧成真，但他们对创建新技术平台的投资为完全不同的客户群打开了大门。这慢慢增加了公司的整体收入和利润。他们没有让恐惧驱动业务，而是让创造力和成长心态引领潮流。

### Collective mindfulness

### 集体正念

At the aforementioned All Day DevOps conference, Kurt Anderson gave a talk on [Collective Mindfulness](https://youtu.be/Vqz2glnGaYE) as a way to ignite multiple people together to achieve more than they can individually. In it, he describes the opposite of mindfulness as mindless where you respond without thinking because you are doing the same thing, the same way. You can’t promote change if you aren’t being mindful—this includes looking at both internal and external aspects of your environment and holding team members jointly accountable in a blameless way.

在前面提到的 All Day DevOps 会议上，Kurt Anderson 发表了关于 [Collective Mindfulness](https://youtu.be/Vqz2glnGaYE) 的演讲，作为一种点燃多人共同实现比单独实现更多的方法。在其中，他将正念的反面描述为无意识，你不假思索地回应，因为你在做同样的事情，同样的方式。如果您不注意，您就无法促进变革——这包括查看环境的内部和外部方面，并以无可指责的方式让团队成员共同承担责任。

Ways to foster collective mindfulness mimic the practices we’ve talked about related to using feature flags:

培养集体正念的方法模仿我们所讨论的与使用功能标志相关的做法：

- Encourage learning - One of the[four pillars of feature management](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/build-the-first-pillar-of-feature-management) is learning. Using feature flags you can experiment, test in production, and gain new knowledge about your application, users, and systems,
- Support staff decisions - Another pillar of feature management is empowering others. A central part of this is supporting the decisions they make.
- Delegate - This is a central part of progressive delivery. Delegate ownership and control to the people who are most responsible.

- 鼓励学习 - [功能管理的四大支柱](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/build-the-first-pillar-of-feature-management) 之一是学习。使用功能标志，您可以在生产中进行试验、测试，并获得有关您的应用程序、用户和系统的新知识，
- 支持员工决策 - 功能管理的另一个支柱是授权他人。其中一个核心部分是支持他们做出的决定。
- 委托 - 这是渐进式交付的核心部分。将所有权和控制权委托给最负责任的人。

## Conclusion 

##  结论

Don’t get emotional, get curious. Ask questions: Why did this happen and how can we make it better? Explore new ways of thinking and doing business. If you look at things from a different perspective, you may wind up seeing opportunities you otherwise would have missed.

不要情绪化，保持好奇。提出问题：为什么会发生这种情况，我们如何使其变得更好？探索新的思维方式和经营方式。如果您从不同的角度看待事物，您可能会看到原本会错过的机会。
