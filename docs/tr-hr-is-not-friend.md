软件、技术、系统管理员战争故事等。 2021 年 1 月 17 日，星期日

HR is not your friend. HR is there to support the company. If you are  not the company, they are not going to be there to support you.

HR 不是你的朋友。 HR 在那里为公司提供支持。如果你不是公司，他们就不会在那里支持你。

HR boils down to paid witnesses in some cases. It changes it from a  "you said, the boss said" thing to two-on-one (or worse). They just pay  attention and maybe give a sworn statement down the road if things turn  truly nasty.

在某些情况下，人力资源归结为付费证人。它将它从“你说，老板说”变成了一对一（或更糟）。他们只是注意，如果事情变得真的很糟糕，他们可能会在路上发表一份宣誓声明。

Who else operates like that? Mall cops and security guards. They don't  have guns. They have phones and notepads. So, it's really mall cops,  security guards... and HR.

还有谁这样操作？商场警察和保安。他们没有枪。他们有电话和记事本。所以，这真的是商场警察、保安……和人力资源。

The only time I ever had a conversation with HR even marginally improve  something is when I was on the "side" of the company and was reporting  something involving personnel to them so they could keep the company  out of trouble.

我唯一一次与 HR 交谈甚至略微改进某些事情的时候是当我站在公司的“一边”并向他们报告涉及人员的事情时，以便他们可以让公司远离麻烦。

That is, person A did something evil to person B, and I was person A's  nominal supervisor. I was required (CA law!) to report it to HR, and I  did, and that was that. HR yelled at person A while I watched. That's  about how it went.

也就是说，A对B做了坏事，我是A的名义上司。我被要求（加州法律！）向人力资源部报告，我做到了，就是这样。在我看着的时候，HR 对着 A 大喊大叫。这就是事情的经过。

If person B had reported it to HR, nothing probably would have happened.

如果 B 将其报告给 HR，则可能什么都不会发生。

This is clear because person B DID in fact report something to them a  different time for someone else, and nothing happened to the evil  person. Why? Because this time the evil person was someone on the  company's side (management), and therefore is going to be somewhat  protected by default.

这很清楚，因为 B 人实际上在不同的时间为其他人向他们报告了一些事情，而邪恶的人没有发生任何事情。为什么？因为这次的恶人是公司方面的某个人（管理层），因此默认情况下会受到一定程度的保护。

"Oh, you're just imagining it". "Oh, it didn't happen". That kind of  stuff.

“哦，你只是想象而已。” “哦，它没有发生”。那种东西。

Expert gaslighters, they are. What really makes me wonder is how the  people keep doing these jobs. Many of them are in the very classes that  get abused by other people regularly. How can you honestly keep doing  that job when you are just enabling the abusers?

专业的煤气灯，他们是。真正让我想知道的是人们是如何继续做这些工作的。他们中的许多人所在的班级经常受到其他人的虐待。当你只是为施虐者提供支持时，你怎么能诚实地继续做这项工作？

Side note: person B's report to HR about this evil person came up in  person B's "calibration session", which is part of performance reviews  at that company. Some quick-witted manager type promptly spoke up and  stopped that particular conversation thread. I was there and heard it  myself.

旁注：B 人向人力资源部报告这个坏人是在 B 人的“校准会议”中提出的，这是该公司绩效评估的一部分。一些机智的经理类型立即发言并停止了那个特定的对话线程。我在那里，自己听到了。

So let's talk about performance reviews now.

所以现在让我们谈谈绩效评估。

Performance reviews are a joke because almost nobody knows how to  measure anyone else's effectiveness. They are just a continuation of  the same popularity contests you thought you left behind from middle  school, high school, and maybe even your college/university days if you  were able to attend such places. The reasoning is simple enough: the  people doing the assessments are still back in that mindset, so it's  unsurprising that they bring it forward into reviews.

绩效评估是个笑话，因为几乎没有人知道如何衡量其他人的效率。它们只是您认为自己从中学、高中，甚至大学/大学时代（如果您能够参加这些地方）就落后的相同人气竞赛的延续。理由很简单：进行评估的人仍然处于这种心态，因此他们将其提交到评论中也就不足为奇了。

Accordingly, hiring reviews are just about as random as performance  reviews. Look at it another way - a performance review is based on  having worked with someone for an extended period of time, and it's  still frequently used to prop up the cronies and knock down anyone who  doesn't spout the party line. Given that an interview is based on a  handful of phone calls and maybe a day of focused interviews, is  it so surprising that they are also broken?

因此，招聘审查与绩效审查一样随机。换个角度看——绩效评估是基于与某人长期合作，它仍然经常被用来支持亲信并击倒任何不说党派路线的人。鉴于面试是基于几个电话，也许是一天的重点面试，所以他们也被打破是不是太令人惊讶了？

Really, most hiring reviews come down to: did this person resemble the  other people we already have here. Never mind if the reason the place  is broken is because they keep hiring the same sort of person and really  need to shift. It's like, how well do they blend in with our *idea* of  what it takes to do the job?

真的，大多数招聘评论归结为：这个人是否与我们这里已有的其他人相似。没关系，这个地方被破坏的原因是否是因为他们一直在雇用同一类人并且确实需要转移。就像，它们与我们完成工作所需的*想法* 的融合程度如何？

Let me say this another way: I have empirically determined that very few  company situations actually give a shit about whether someone is bad at  their job. It doesn't matter how much data you produce or stories you  can come up with. If it doesn't fit the narrative someone else wants to  push, nothing will happen to them. Also, if *you* push hard enough to  "fix" the situation, guess what? YOU become the problem. 

让我换一种方式说：我凭经验确定，很少有公司情况会真正关心某人是否不擅长工作。无论您产生多少数据或可以想出多少故事，这都无关紧要。如果它不符合其他人想要推动的叙述，他们就不会发生任何事情。此外，如果*你*努力“解决”这种情况，你猜怎么着？你成了问题。

One exception to this that I've found is when someone already has  plans for getting rid of someone and just needs the "ammo". At that  point, they will quickly become your "friend" in order to get all of  the dirt on that person, and then once the deed is done, it'll be like  you never existed to them.

我发现的一个例外是当有人已经有摆脱某人的计划并且只需要“弹药”时。那个时候，他们会很快成为你的“朋友”，把那个人的所有污点都抹掉，然后一旦事成，他们就好像你从来没有存在过一样。

Alternatively, if you can prove the person is harming the company  somehow, then yeah, they will probably gang up on them and that'll be  that. But, again, it has to be something visible that lines up with  whatever their party line may be. "Sits there moistening a chair and  never does anything useful" is not sufficient. It has to be something  really nasty like "exposes the company to lawsuits". THEN they start  paying attention.

或者，如果你能证明这个人以某种方式损害了公司，那么是的，他们可能会联合起来对付他们，就是这样。但是，同样，它必须是可见的，与他们的党派路线保持一致。 “坐在那里弄湿椅子，从不做任何有用的事情”是不够的。它必须是非常令人讨厌的事情，例如“使公司面临诉讼”。然后他们开始注意。

Imagine every bad "evil villain" trope you've ever witnessed by watching  crappy TV dramas or bad movies. They're not that much of a stretch. Some of those screenwriters probably worked in companies like this  before putting pen to paper.

想象一下你看过蹩脚的电视剧或糟糕的电影所见过的每一个坏的“恶棍”比喻。他们并没有那么牵强。其中一些编剧可能在付诸实践之前在这样的公司工作过。

In terms of weirdly broken people, there are many different types. If  you are the sort who honestly expects everyone to be reasonable, honest  and generally agreeable, prepare to be shocked. The longer it takes you  to realize this, the longer the most evil ones will take advantage of  you.

就奇形怪状的人而言，有很多不同的类型。如果你是那种真诚地期望每个人都合理、诚实和普遍友善的人，请准备好受到打击。你意识到这一点的时间越长，最邪恶的人利用你的时间就越长。

One type you should be aware of is the person who will change their  story from day to day in order to "win" the "argument" that's currently  underway. If you have a decent memory for conversations, you might  think you are losing your mind, because surely this person was FOR this  last week, but now they are AGAINST it?

您应该注意的一种类型是为了“赢得”当前正在进行的“争论”而日复一日地改变他们的故事的人。如果你对谈话有很好的记忆力，你可能会认为你正在失去理智，因为这个人上周肯定是为了这个，但现在他们反对了吗？

It's not because they decided to change their mind - people are  certainly allowed (and expected) to shift based on new information. It's just so they win this time. Come back to them a few days later,  and they might be in yet another spot.

这不是因为他们决定改变主意——人们当然被允许（并期望）根据新信息进行转变。只是这次他们赢了。几天后回到他们身边，他们可能会在另一个地方。

Imagine working with a person like this when you're trying to get  something done that involves their team acting like a gatekeeper. You  get the approval from them on doing something one way, then plow a bunch  of time into developing it, and then when it's time to deliver things,  that same person gets in the way and stops the whole affair.

想象一下，当您试图完成一些涉及他们的团队像看门人一样的事情时，与这样的人一起工作。你以一种方式做某事得到他们的批准，然后投入大量时间来开发它，然后当需要交付东西时，同一个人会挡路并停止整个事情。

This really happens in some isolated cases, and it's maddening as hell. In those situations, you really come to appreciate your chat logs. Of  course, if they have been sticking to in-person chats (in normal times,  not now, obviously) or phone/video calls, good luck! Those usually  aren't logged. Wiretapping laws are funny that way.

这种情况确实发生在一些孤立的情况下，而且令人发狂。在这些情况下，您真的会很感激您的聊天记录。当然，如果他们一直坚持面对面聊天（在正常时期，显然不是现在）或电话/视频通话，祝你好运！这些通常不会被记录。这样的窃听法很有趣。

...

I have another thought here and can't come up with a decent segue so  we'll just do a needle-scratch and jump right into it. This one is that  sometimes the "full bird" higher-ups at a company are in fact powerless. It doesn't matter if their title is VP or SVP or CTO or whatever. When  the rubber meets the road, they may be a figurehead, unable to make  things actually stick.

我在这里有另一个想法，无法想出一个像样的转场，所以我们只是做一个针头划伤，然后直接跳进去。这就是有时公司的“全鸟”上级实际上是无能为力的。不管他们的头衔是 VP、SVP 还是 CTO 或其他什么。当橡胶遇到道路时，他们可能是傀儡，无法使事情真正粘住。

I learned about a situation like this from someone who's been deeply  involved with any number of companies and wound up at one of those  high-level positions at one later in their career. They were supposed  to be the final word on the technical details of what went out the door. This person is the real deal, incidentally. They know the ins and outs  of the whole situation, and was exactly who you'd want in that position.

我从一个深入参与过许多公司并在其职业生涯后期担任其中一个高级职位的人那里了解到这种情况。他们应该是关于出门的技术细节的最终决定。顺便说一句，这个人是真正的交易。他们知道整个情况的来龙去脉，而且正是你想要的那个位置。

In that role, the company gave them the power to say "this way and not  that way", but also put this person in the spot of being responsible  for whatever happened as a result. It was on them to make good  decisions that made sense in terms of the existing product line, the  ones under development, and the stuff they wanted to do. 

在这个角色中，公司赋予他们说“这样和不那样”的权力，但也让这个人对所发生的一切负责。他们有责任在现有产品线、正在开发的产品线以及他们想做的事情方面做出明智的决定。

Then, one day, one of those decisions came to a head and needed the  final call from this person. They made the call to go one particular  way since it made better engineering sense with the work they were  already doing. What the other people wanted would add far more variance  to their eng work and would generally be incompatible with the existing  stuff. There was no benefit to it, other than some other person  "getting their way".

然后，有一天，其中一个决定浮出水面，需要这个人做出最后的决定。他们呼吁采用一种特定的方式，因为这对他们已经在做的工作具有更好的工程意义。其他人想要的东西会给他们的工程工作增加更多的差异，并且通常与现有的东西不兼容。除了某些其他人“顺其自然”之外，它没有任何好处。

It came down to this: either this person was in fact their head honcho  of whatever it was, and they were making that decision, or they were  not. The company said... you are not. It was as simple as that.

归结为：要么这个人实际上是他们的主要负责人，他们正在做出那个决定，要么他们不是。公司说……你不是。就这么简单。

They didn't stick around after that. Would you?

在那之后，他们没有留下来。你会？

So, if you've ever thought that jumping into management and/or climbing  the ladder into the upper ranks would help you, yeah, well, ... not so  much. When push comes to shove, you can still lose and find out you  never actually had any leverage.

所以，如果你曾经想过进入管理层和/或爬上高层会帮助你，是的，好吧，......不是那么多。当迫在眉睫时，您仍然可能会输，并发现您实际上从未有过任何影响力。

Just remember: reasonable exchanges only happen with reasonable people.

请记住：合理的交流只发生在合理的人身上。
