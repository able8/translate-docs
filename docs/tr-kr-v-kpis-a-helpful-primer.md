# OKRs v KPIs - How they work together

# OKR 与 KPI - 它们如何协同工作

TL;DR - There is a natural overlap between key results and key performance  indicators. A metric can move in either direction depending on the focus of the business and the state of the metric.

TL;DR - 关键结果和关键绩效指标之间存在自然重叠。指标可以向任一方向移动，具体取决于业务重点和指标状态。

KPIs and KRs (the  Key Results of OKR) are powerful tools, but I’ve seen an increasing  amount of bad advice on the subject. In a desire to make the definitions of KPIs and KRs clean, many observers state that a single metric is  either a KR or a KPI, but it can’t be both.

KPI 和 KR（OKR 的关键结果）是强大的工具，但我已经看到越来越多关于该主题的糟糕建议。为了使 KPI 和 KR 的定义清晰，许多观察家指出，单个指标要么是 KR，要么是 KPI，但不能两者兼而有之。

As a definition it  keeps things simple, but the distinction is artificial and inhibiting. The main difference between a KR and a KPI is timing and context. Let’s pick this apart with a question.


作为一个定义，它使事情变得简单，但这种区别是人为的和抑制性的。 KR 和 KPI 之间的主要区别在于时间和上下文。让我们用一个问题来区分这一点。


### What job is your metric doing?

### 你的指标在做什么工作？

I believe there are two main jobs that a metric does in this context.

我相信在这种情况下，度量标准有两个主要工作。

1. Represent the current measurable outcome we are working towards.
2. Provide a measure of something that is important to the business, but is not the current focus of your work.



1. 代表我们正在努力实现的当前可衡量的结果。
2. 提供对业务重要但不是您当前工作重点的事物的衡量标准。

OKR is concerned with number 1 and key results are the metrics  you are currently focused on impacting. This is your most important  work. Ideally you are reviewing these on a weekly basis.

OKR 关注数字 1，关键结果是您当前关注的指标。这是你最重要的工作。理想情况下，您每周都会查看这些内容。

KPIs are concerned with number 2. [Felipe Castro](https://felipecastro.com/en/blog/okr-vs-kpis/) calls them Health Metrics, because they tell you if everything is okay with the business.

KPI 与数字 2 相关。[Felipe Castro](https://felipecastro.com/en/blog/okr-vs-kpis/) 称它们为健康指标，因为它们会告诉您业务是否一切正常。

### The overlap

### 重叠

My argument is that a particular metric can be used for 1 or 2, depending on the focus.

我的论点是特定的指标可以用于 1 或 2，具体取决于重点。

Let’s work through a simplified example.

让我们看一个简化的例子。

This is applied to a B2B SaaS I’ve worked with, but could apply to many different products.

这适用于我使用过的 B2B SaaS，但也适用于许多不同的产品。

This is a mature product and customers are loyal. Churn is less than 5% and  we’re happy as long as it remains under 7.5%. We’ve looked at the data  behind churn and decided there are too many different factors to make  reducing it further cost effective right now.

这是一个成熟的产品，客户是忠诚的。流失率低于 5%，只要它保持在 7.5% 以下，我们就很高兴。我们查看了流失背后的数据，并认为目前有太多不同的因素无法进一步降低流失的成本效益。

Naturally we keep an eye on it, every month we look at the churn data and it’s on senior leaders’ radar. It really is a **Key** performance Indicator.

我们自然会密切关注它，每个月我们都会查看流失数据，并且它在高层领导的雷达上。这确实是一个**关键**性能指标。

Our current focus is getting more website visitors to start a trial of our product and our OKRs reflect that priority.

我们目前的重点是让更多网站访问者开始试用我们的产品，我们的 OKR 反映了这一优先事项。

A few month’s later we’ve made good progress on acquisition but churn has ticked upwards. It’s now 11% and it is seriously jeopardising our  bottom line.

几个月后，我们在收购方面取得了不错的进展，但客户流失率有所上升。现在是 11%，这严重危及我们的底线。

### Time to focus on that KPI

### 是时候关注该 KPI

Leaders are concerned and want to focus on this problem. At the next OKR  setting a cross-functional team is charged with reducing churn. The logical decision is to make this KPI a key result.

领导很关心，想重点解决这个问题。在下一个 OKR 设置中，跨职能团队负责减少流失。合乎逻辑的决定是使该 KPI 成为关键结果。

That team  includes a product person, an engineering lead and a service desk  person. Unless the team stumbles upon an obvious cause and finds a very quick solution, they will treat churn as their key result for a period  of time. Identifying and testing hypotheses as they go. As a strong team they are considering several opportunities and solutions at once.

该团队包括一名产品人员、一名工程主管和一名服务台人员。除非团队偶然发现一个明显的原因并找到一个非常快速的解决方案，否则他们会在一段时间内将流失视为他们的关键结果。在进行时识别和测试假设。作为一个强大的团队，他们正在同时考虑多个机会和解决方案。

After some great product discovery work the team makes some changes and churn is reduced. Please note, in the real world, churn is usually a lagging  measure. To counter this the team may identify one or more leading  metrics.

在一些伟大的产品发现工作之后，团队做出了一些改变并减少了流失。请注意，在现实世界中，流失通常是一种滞后措施。为了解决这个问题，团队可以确定一个或多个领先指标。

### Carry on tracking, but focus elsewhere

### 继续跟踪，但专注于其他地方

With the problem solved sufficiently well, the team can focus on a new  problem. Churn goes back to being a KPI and the leading metrics the team identify is added to the set.

问题解决得足够好，团队就可以专注于新问题。 Churn 重新成为 KPI，团队确定的主要指标被添加到集合中。

The point I am making with this example is that KRs and KPIs are tools. They either help you:

- keep a track on things that are important but not a strategic priority, or
- track progress towards current strategic outcomes.

我在这个例子中的重点是 KR 和 KPI 是工具。他们要么帮助你：

- 跟踪重要但不是战略重点的事情，或
- 跟踪当前战略成果的进展。

In either case they’re an important measure of business success. In a future post I will go deeper into this example to explore the  connection between leading and lagging measures. It will also help us  understand how organisation and team key results can connect.

无论哪种情况，它们都是衡量企业成功的重要指标。在以后的文章中，我将更深入地研究这个例子，以探讨领先和滞后措施之间的联系。它还将帮助我们了解组织和团队的关键结果如何相互关联。

### An engineering focused example: 

### 一个以工程为中心的例子：

Load time for our search page is a KPI. We’ve got a sound  architecture and this metric has been within threshold for many  quarters. We then see  load time has crept up and our own research  tells us that this is a leading indicator for reduced usage. We make  reducing page load time a priority for the next quarter and a KR is  created.

我们搜索页面的加载时间是一个 KPI。我们有一个健全的架构，这个指标在许多方面都在阈值之内。然后我们看到加载时间已经增加，我们自己的研究告诉我们这是减少使用的领先指标。我们将减少页面加载时间作为下个季度的优先事项，并创建了 KR。

A cross-functional team quickly identifies a few contributing factors and tests and builds the required solutions. They soon have the page  load time back where it needs to be and the metric is back as a KPI  only.

跨职能团队可以快速确定一些影响因素并进行测试并构建所需的解决方案。他们很快将页面加载时间恢复到需要的位置，并且指标仅作为 KPI 恢复。

Hopefully these couple of examples help explain why there can be  overlap between KPIs and KRs. Quite simply we should only be looking at  metrics that are important. If something we track (a KPI) is critically  unaligned, then we should focus on it (a KR). No need for dogma. 

希望这几个例子有助于解释为什么 KPI 和 KR 之间可能存在重叠。很简单，我们应该只关注重要的指标。如果我们跟踪的内容（KPI）严重不一致，那么我们应该关注它（KR）。不需要教条。
