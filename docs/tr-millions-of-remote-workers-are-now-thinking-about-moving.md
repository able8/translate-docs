This year Facebook announced half its employees can now [permanently work from home](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/21/860382831/facebook-expects-half-its-employees-to-work-remotely-forever). And elsewhere in the Bay Area, local newspapers even reported that a regional government agency voted in September to “move forward” with a proposal to require large, office-based companies to implement working from home for employees at least 60% of each week by the year 2035. Though that proposal quickly [drew criticism from other local officials](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/california-s-bay-area-likes-telecommuting-so-much-it-might-n1240898), it points to something new: a widespread reappraisal of the possibilities of remote working.

今年 Facebook 宣布其一半员工现在可以永久在家工作。在湾区的其他地方，当地报纸甚至报道说，一个地区政府机构在 9 月投票决定“向前推进”，提议要求大型办公室公司在每周至少 60% 的时间为员工实施在家工作。 2035 年。尽管该提议很快[引起了其他地方官员的批评](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/california-s-bay-area-likes-telecommuting-so-much-it-might-n1240898)，它指出了一些新的东西：对远程工作可能性的广泛重新评估。

In fact, because of remote working, millions of teleworkers are now thinking about moving, according to a new survey by the freelancing platform Upwork. They suggest it could be “the [biggest, fastest transformation of the labor market since the World World II mobilization](https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/economist-report-remote-workers-on-the-move).”

事实上，根据自由职业平台 Upwork 的一项新调查，由于远程工作，数百万远程工作者现在正在考虑搬家。他们认为这可能是“[自第二次世界大战动员以来劳动力市场最大、最快的转变](https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/economist-report-remote-workers-on-the-移动)。”

## New Opportunities

##  新的机会

America’s civilian labor workforce is over 160 million, according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm). Yet Upwork calculates that a surprisingly large percentage are now planning to relocate because of new opportunities created by remote work: between 14 million and 23 million Americans. That’s between 6.9% and 11.5% of all American households — but that may be just the beginning. “Combined with those who are moving regardless of remote work, near-term migration rates may be three to four times what they normally are.”

根据 [劳工统计局] (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm)，美国的文职劳动力超过 1.6 亿。然而，Upwork 计算出，由于远程工作创造的新机会，现在计划搬迁的比例大得惊人：1400 万至 2300 万美国人。这占所有美国家庭的 6.9% 至 11.5%——但这可能只是开始。 “加上那些不顾远程工作而搬家的人，近期的迁移率可能是正常情况的三到四倍。”

Their results are based on a survey of 20,000 people conducted using Google Consumer Surveys during the first 15 days of October. (The range of results reflects a slightly different wording of the question in different versions of the survey.)

他们的结果基于 10 月前 15 天使用 Google 消费者调查对 20,000 人进行的调查。 （结果范围反映了不同版本的调查中问题的措辞略有不同。）

BLS is not the only one that has spotted the trend. NPR also [cites research from United Van Lines](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/30/929667563/now-that-more-americans-can-work-anywhere-many-are-planning-to-move-away) (conducted from March through August) which found Americans were 32% more interested in moving this year than the year before. It seems like those statistics could be influenced by the pandemic. One commonly cited reason was concern for personal health — and that survey also found people wanted to leave New York State at higher-than-average rates. But it also found the number of people who wanted to leave San Francisco was more than twice the national average — though that city has remained [one of the healthiest](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Two-big-reasons-SF-has-the-lowest-death-rate-15597761.php) throughout the pandemic. 

BLS 并不是唯一发现这一趋势的人。 NPR 还 引用了 United Van Lines 的研究，（从 3 月到 8 月进行）发现美国人今年对搬家的兴趣比前一年高出 32%。似乎这些统计数据可能会受到大流行的影响。一个普遍提到的原因是对个人健康的担忧——该调查还发现，人们想以高于平均水平的速度离开纽约州。但它也发现想要离开旧金山的人数是全国平均水平的两倍多——尽管该城市仍然是[最健康的城市之一](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Two-big-reasons-SF-has-the-lowest-death-rate-15597761.php)在整个大流行期间。

That suggests another possible reason: housing prices. And San Francisco's rental market remains the most expensive in all of America, according to stats from the real estate site Zumper [cited by the San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices-drop-again-in-SF-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php). In fact, Upwork's survey found that more than half of the respondents (52.5%) were specifically planning to move into housing that was “significantly more affordable” than their current homes (at least 10% cheaper) — while only 25% specified they' d be moving into a more expensive home. And the desire for cheaper housing was most pronounced among those who planned to move out of a major city.

这暗示了另一个可能的原因：房价。根据房地产网站 Zumper 的统计数据，旧金山的租赁市场仍然是全美最昂贵的 [旧金山纪事报引用](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices- drop-in-SF-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php）。事实上，Upwork 的调查发现，超过一半的受访者 (52.5%) 特别计划搬进比他们目前的房屋“明显更负担得起”的住房（至少便宜 10%)——而只有 25% 的人表示他们' d 搬进更贵的房子。那些计划搬出大城市的人对更便宜的住房的渴望最为明显。

Citing data from [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com), Upwork also sees this migration reflected in rental prices. “The most expensive places have seen the biggest decline in demand, while lower cost of living places have seen stronger demand.”

引用来自 [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com) 的数据，Upwork 还认为这种迁移反映在租金价格中。 “最昂贵的地方需求下降幅度最大，而生活成本较低的地方需求更强劲。”

Adam Ozimek, Upwork’s chief economist, summarized their survey’s key insight to NPR: “Many people see remote work as an opportunity to relocate to where they want and where they can afford to live.”

Upwork 的首席经济学家亚当·奥齐梅克 (Adam Ozimek) 总结了他们对 NPR 的调查的关键见解：“许多人将远程工作视为搬迁到他们想要和负担得起的地方的机会。”

## Reevaluating What’s Important

## 重新评估什么是重要的

United Van Lines also found other factors at work, NPR reports. “Customers told the moving company that the pandemic made them reevaluate what was important to their family, which meant being closer to extended family and friends. Other customers said they had to widen their job search to out of state.”

据 NPR 报道，United Van Lines 还发现了其他因素在起作用。 “客户告诉搬家公司，大流行让他们重新评估对家人来说什么是重要的，这意味着与大家庭和朋友更接近。其他客户表示，他们不得不将求职范围扩大到州外。”

And Upwork’s respondents were twice as likely to say they were moving to someplace with a lower population density than to somewhere with a higher density. In fact, 20.6% of the city-dwellers in the survey said they were planning a move, versus 8.6% of those living in a mid-size city or its surrounding suburbs (and another 12.2% living in a suburb).

Upwork 的受访者表示，他们搬到人口密度较低的地方的可能性是人口密度较高的地方的两倍。事实上，调查中 20.6% 的城市居民表示他们正在计划搬家，而居住在中等城市或其周边郊区的人中有 8.6%（另有 12.2% 的人居住在郊区）。

But whatever the reason, Upwork found that more than half their respondents were clearly taking advantage of the opportunities of telecommuting: “54.7% of people are moving over two hours away or more from their current location, which is beyond daily or even weekly commuting distances for most.” About 41.5% were actually moving more than 4 hours away, while 13.2% were moving within 2 to 4 hours of their current home. Upwork argues these stats “further supports the notion of a growing separation of where people work and where they live.”

但无论是什么原因，Upwork 发现超过一半的受访者显然在利用远程办公的机会：“54.7% 的人从当前位置搬家超过两个小时或更长时间，这超出了每天甚至每周的通勤距离对于大多数。”大约 41.5% 的人实际上搬家超过 4 小时，而 13.2% 的人搬家在他们当前家的 2 到 4 小时内。 Upwork 认为，这些统计数据“进一步支持人们工作和居住地日益分离的观点。”

Upwork argues these trends may redistribute America’s workforce. “Over the past few decades, work opportunities have become increasingly concentrated in a handful of superstar cities. At the same time, a lack of new housing supply and high building regulations in these cities have drastically risen the cost of living.” It points out that in Silicon Valley cities like San Jose and San Francisco, the median price of a home is “well above $1 million…”

Upwork 认为这些趋势可能会重新分配美国的劳动力。 “在过去的几十年里，工作机会越来越集中在少数超级明星城市。与此同时，这些城市缺乏新的住房供应和严格的建筑法规，大大提高了生活成本。”它指出，在圣何塞和旧金山等硅谷城市，房屋的中位价“远高于 100 万美元……”

However, “Remote work has presented an alternative to this by allowing us to disconnect where we work from where we live.” 

然而，“远程工作为我们提供了一种替代方案，它允许我们将工作地点与居住地点分开。”

Upwork points out this gives businesses the opportunity to hire from a much larger pool of talent — though Upwork may have a stake in some of those decisions. The company provides job listings for freelancers looking for work, and was formed when the freelancer platforms oDesk and Elance merged in 2013, then [rebranded themselves in 2015](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2015/05/05/elance-odesk-becomes-upwork-today-odesk-brand-gets-phased-out/?sh=403a8eef51f5). The company’s web page now boasts [millions](https://www.upwork.com/about/) of jobs are posted each year on the site, and it keeps a close eye on the industry. In September the company calculated that [59 million Americans had performed freelance work](https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/new-upwork-study-finds-36-of-the-us-workforce-freelance-amid-the-covid-19-pandemic) within the previous 12 months, “representing 36% of the US workforce, an increase of 2 million freelancers since 2019,” and “contributing $1.2 trillion to the economy.” (While 10% of the workforce had paused their freelancing, 12% had _begun_ freelancing.)

Upwork 指出，这让企业有机会从更大的人才库中进行招聘——尽管 Upwork 可能会参与其中的一些决策。该公司为找工作的自由职业者提供职位列表，成立于 2013 年自由职业者平台 oDesk 和 Elance 合并，然后 [2015 年更名](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2015/05 /05/elance-odesk-becomes-upwork-today-odesk-brand-gets-phased-out/?sh=403a8eef51f5）。该公司的网页现在拥有 [数百万](https://www.upwork.com/about/) 每年在该网站上发布的职位，并密切关注该行业。 9 月，该公司计算出 [5900 万美国人从事自由职业](https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/new-upwork-study-finds-36-of-the-us-workforce-freelance-在 Covid-19 大流行期间）在过去 12 个月内，“占美国劳动力的 36%，自 2019 年以来增加了 200 万自由职业者”，并且“为经济贡献了 1.2 万亿美元”。 （虽然 10% 的员工暂停了他们的自由职业，但 12% 的员工_开始_自由职业。)

## Going Global

## 走向全球

How far will this trend go? And could it spread internationally? Last year tech companies in Helsinki, Finland began touting “ [City as a Service](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/helsinki-worlds-first-city-as-a-service-is-not-just-a-joke---attracts-over-6500-applications-from-100-cities-300960656.html)” — a “talent attraction campaign” that provided a free, 90-day relocation package to successful applicants to encourage them to move into their country. It’s now announced [another season of the program](https://www.helsinkibusinesshub.fi/90-day-finn/) — and it’s not the only city trying to attract new talent.

这种趋势会走多远？它能在国际上传播吗？去年芬兰赫尔辛基的科技公司开始吹捧“[城市即服务](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/helsinki-worlds-first-city-as-a-service-is-not-just-a-joke---attracts-over-6500-applications-from-100-cities-300960656.html)”——一项“人才吸引活动”，为成功申请者提供了一个免费的 90 天搬迁套餐以鼓励他们进入他们的国家。现在宣布[该计划的另一个季节](https://www.helsinkibusinesshub.fi/90-day-finn/)——而且它并不是唯一一个试图吸引新人才的城市。

Forbes recently reported variations on the “digital nomad visa” were [now being offered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/06/08/estonia-woos-remote-workers-with-a-digital-nomad-visa/) by Estonia, Germany, Portugal, and the Czech Republic. But it also noted the Remote Shoals program in Alabama was offering a $10,000 premium paid out over the first year of relocation.

福布斯最近报道了“数字游牧签证”的变化[现在正在提供](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/06/08/estonia-woos-remote-workers-with-a-digital-nomad-visa/) 由爱沙尼亚、德国、葡萄牙和捷克共和国提供。但它还指出，阿拉巴马州的偏远浅滩计划在搬迁的第一年提供了 10,000 美元的溢价。

There’s more signs that America’s smaller cities hope to attract remote workers who want to relocate. The real estate news site Millionacres noted this week that Tulsa, Oklahoma is [offering $10,000 to 250 remote workers who will relocate to the city](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/these-cities-will-pay-you-10000-move-there/) for one year — while Topeka, Kansas will offer $10,000 to qualifying remote workers who purchase a home in the city (or $5,000 to re-locaters who rent). And it also notes that Savannah, Georgia, also has a program offering up to $2,000 to remote tech workers who relocate to the city.

有更多迹象表明，美国的小城市希望吸引想要搬迁的远程工作者。房地产新闻网站 Millionacres 本周指出，俄克拉荷马州塔尔萨市 [向将搬迁到该市的 250 名远程工作者提供 10,000 美元](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/these -cities-will-pay-you-10000-move-there/）为期一年——而堪萨斯州托皮卡市将向在该市购买房屋的合格远程工作者提供 10,000 美元（或向租房的重新定位者提供 5,000 美元)。它还指出，佐治亚州的萨凡纳 (Savannah) 也有一项计划，为搬迁到该市的远程技术工作者提供高达 2,000 美元的补助。

“Everyone wants to pay you to leave the Bay Area,” quipped [a headline in June at the Hustle](https://thehustle.co/06232020-relocation-bay-area/).

“每个人都想付钱让你离开湾区，”[6 月 Hustle 的头条新闻](https://thehustle.co/06232020-relocation-bay-area/) 打趣道。

What happens next is anyone’s guess. But Upwork’s announcement of their survey’s results seems to culminate with a call to action, or at least, to ask the inevitable follow-up question. “Paying high housing costs is no longer a requirement for accessing high paying labor markets, and the geography of where people can live greatly expands.

接下来会发生什么是任何人的猜测。但 Upwork 宣布他们的调查结果似乎以行动呼吁告终，或者至少是提出不可避免的后续问题。 “支付高昂的住房成本不再是进入高薪劳动力市场的必要条件，人们可以居住的地域范围大大扩大。

“But will professionals seize this moment as an opportunity to relocate?”

“但专业人士会不会抓住这个时机搬迁？”
