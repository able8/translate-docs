Over the past 3.5 years my career has grown and transformed from Individual Contributor (IC) to an Engineering Manager of multiple teams, and all the roles in between as I built the Azure Sphere Security Services (AS3) Team from 2 people to 20 people. I undertook this journey in the Summer of 2017 to help transform a [Microsoft Research project, Project Sopri](https://www.wired.com/story/project-sopris-iot-security/) s, into a Generally Available ( GA) product [Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/).

在过去的 3.5 年里，我的职业生涯不断发展，从个人贡献者 (IC) 转变为多个团队的工程经理，以及在我构建 Azure Sphere 安全服务 (AS3) 团队时，从 2 人到 20 人之间的所有角色。我在 2017 年夏天开始了这个旅程，以帮助将 [Microsoft Research 项目，Project Sopri](https://www.wired.com/story/project-sopris-iot-security/) 转变为一个普遍可用的 ( GA) 产品 [Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/)。

As the AS3 Team grew, I went through a massive amount of personal growth and learning as well. In December 2017 I stepped into a manager role for the first time in my career. I had been a professional software engineer for over a decade at this point, and was up for a totally new challenge. I knew that the skills and job of growing and managing a team and then an organization were totally different than what I had been actively developing over the last decade of my career. As I went through this period of growth I was lucky enough to have several friends, coaches, and mentors share their experiences with me, and recommend some great books to help me along my learning journey.

随着 AS3 团队的成长，我也经历了大量的个人成长和学习。 2017 年 12 月，我在职业生涯中首次担任经理职务。此时，我已经成为专业软件工程师十多年了，准备迎接全新的挑战。我知道发展和管理团队和组织的技能和工作与我过去十年职业生涯中积极发展的完全不同。在我经历这段成长的过程中，我很幸运有几位朋友、教练和导师与我分享他们的经验，并推荐一些好书来帮助我完成学习之旅。

Below is my curated list of the most influential and impactful books that helped me along the way, and that I highly recommend to Engineering Managers

以下是我精心挑选的最有影响力和影响力的书籍清单，这些书籍一直帮助我，我强烈推荐给工程经理

## The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth & Change by Camille Fournier

## 经理之路：技术领导者成长与变革指南，作者：Camille Fournier

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BHEtpF4eL._SY346_.jpg)

This is a must read for anyone considering managing engineering teams, it is as good as or better than the hype surrounding it. The book starts off from the individual contributor perspective and then each subsequent chapter explores the next level of management complexity. Each chapter focuses on an engineering management role, like technical lead, manager of people, or manager of multiple teams, and manager of managers.

对于任何考虑管理工程团队的人来说，这是一本必读的书，它与围绕它的炒作一样好或更好。本书从个人贡献者的角度出发，随后的每一章都探讨了管理复杂性的下一个层次。每一章都侧重于一个工程管理角色，如技术主管、人员经理或多个团队的经理，以及经理的经理。

Over the past 3.5 years I’ve come back to this book several times, re-reading the chapters around my newest role. For instance when I transitioned into a manager of managers role, I re-read that chapter and the one before and after it. These were great reminders on what I should be focused on, what challenges my directs were facing, and what challenges and motivations my boss was focused on.

在过去的 3.5 年里，我多次回到这本书，重新阅读有关我最新角色的章节。例如，当我转任经理角色时，我重新阅读了该章节以及之前和之后的章节。这些都很好地提醒了我应该关注什么，我的主管面临哪些挑战，以及我的老板关注哪些挑战和动机。

One of the sections I really loved was on debugging dysfunctional teams. As an engineer I am a great debugger, often able to piece together logs, metrics, and weird behavior to diagnose what’s going wrong in a system. This was the first time I had seen the term debugging applied to people and organizations, and it helped frame the work of how to start investigating dysfunction in a team, and how to discover the source of the problem.

我真正喜欢的部分之一是调试功能失调的团队。作为一名工程师，我是一名出色的调试员，经常能够将日志、指标和奇怪的行为拼凑在一起，以诊断系统中出了什么问题。这是我第一次看到术语调试适用于人和组织，它帮助构建了如何开始调查团队中的功能障碍以及如何发现问题根源的工作。

Honestly I recommend this book to every engineer, solely for the chapter on how to be managed, and what you should and can expect from your manager. Even if you never plan on taking on a management role this book provides an excellent overview of the challenges and motivations of folks in varying levels of an engineering organization and will help you better navigate your org.

老实说，我向每一位工程师推荐这本书，专门介绍如何管理以及您应该和可以从您的经理那里得到什么的一章。即使您从未打算担任管理职务，本书也很好地概述了工程组织不同级别人员的挑战和动机，并将帮助您更好地驾驭您的组织。

## Thanks for the Feedback by Douglas Stone & Sheila Heen

## 感谢 Douglas Stone 和 Sheila Heen 的反馈

Prior to managing I had given peer feedback as part of performance reviews at various companies, but I did not consider this a strength of mine. Now giving feedback was a critical skill for my role as a manager. Early on I sought out several resources on how to give and receive feedback well, and found “Thanks for the Feedback” to be an tremendous resource.

在担任管理职务之前，我曾在多家公司的绩效评估中提供同行反馈，但我并不认为这是我的强项。现在，提供反馈是我作为经理的一项关键技能。早些时候，我寻找了一些关于如何很好地提供和接收反馈的资源，并发现“感谢反馈”是一个巨大的资源。

![](https://blackwells.co.uk/jacket/l/9780670922635.jpg)

Thanks for the Feedback is framed as a resource for receiving and processing the multitudes of feedback you receive. However, any one who reads this book, will also learn how to be a more skilled feedback giver. 

感谢您的反馈被构建为接收和处理您收到的大量反馈的资源。然而，任何阅读本书的人，也将学会如何成为一名更有技巧的反馈者。

I highly recommend reading the book in its entirety, but I wanted to share one of the fundamental ideas in this book that resonated with me. Feedback is really three different things, with three different purposes:

我强烈建议完整阅读这本书，但我想分享本书中引起我共鸣的基本思想之一。反馈实际上是三种不同的东西，具有三种不同的目的：

- **Appreciation**,  the goal is to help people feel appreciated. Sometimes they may just need motivation and encouragement to keep going when tackling tough problems
- **Coaching**, the goal is to help the receiver expand their knowledge, sharpen skills, and increase confidence.
- **Evaluation,** the goal here is to rate or rank the receiver’s work against a set of standards to align expectations and inform decision making.

- **欣赏**，目的是让人们感受到被欣赏。有时他们可能只需要动力和鼓励来解决棘手的问题
- **Coaching**，目标是帮助接收者扩展知识，提高技能，增加信心。
- **评估，**这里的目标是根据一组标准对接收者的工作进行评级或排名，以调整期望并为决策提供信息。

This idea that feedback serves a variety of different purposes was eye opening, and help me more clearly think about how and when to provide feedback. Taking this perspective along with the multitude of lessons learned from this book was tremendously helpful to me.

这种反馈服务于各种不同目的的想法让我大开眼界，并帮助我更清楚地思考如何以及何时提供反馈。将这种观点与从本书中学到的大量经验教训结合起来，对我非常有帮助。

## The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz

## 关于困难的困难：在没有简单答案的情况下建立企业本·霍洛维茨 (Ben Horowitz)

[![](https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=701)](https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg)

-1.jpeg)

The book starts off acknowledging a problem with most management books “they attempt to provide a recipe for challenges that have no recipes. There’s no recipe for really complicated, dynamic situations.” This instantly resonated with me as I was reading it in November 2019.  I had been a manager for about two years, and had grown the AS3 team from 2 to 15 people. We’d spent the past two years turning a research project into what would soon be a GA’d product in February 2020.  There is no recipe for how to do this, what I was doing was a hard thing.

这本书一开始就承认了大多数管理书籍的一个问题，“它们试图为没有秘诀的挑战提供秘诀。对于真正复杂、动态的情况，没有秘诀。”当我在 2019 年 11 月阅读它时，这立即引起了我的共鸣。我担任了大约两年的经理，并将 AS3 团队从 2 人增加到 15 人。在过去的两年里，我们一直在将一个研究项目转变为很快就会在 2020 年 2 月成为 GA 产品的产品。没有如何做到这一点的秘诀，我正在做的事情很困难。

Horowitz packs the book with a variety of entertaining stories from his career as a venture capitalist and entrepreneur to emphasize his message and points on leadership and various challenges. In addition there are a few key takeaways that have stayed with me.

霍洛维茨在本书中收录了他作为风险投资家和企业家的职业生涯中的各种有趣故事，以强调他在领导力和各种挑战方面的信息和观点。此外，还有一些重要的收获一直伴随着我。

- **Take care of the people, the product, and the profits in that order**. This quote resonated with me and the kind of organization I want to build and run. Chapter 5, which bears this quote as a title goes into some of the challenges that can arise when setting out with this mission and how to overcome them, like hiring, training, and management debt.
- **Part of Management is training your people.** In big companies this is often neglected as it’s the role of HR or corporate to produce training programs. These can sometimes be valuable but are often overly generic. As a manager make sure you are training your people for the specific job they are doing. Things like how to work in your specific code base, what are the architectural standards and guidelines, what makes a good design doc, etc…Make sure you are intentionally designing on boarding programs, meetings, and workshops to facilitate learning.

- **按顺序照顾人、产品和利润**。这句话引起了我的共鸣以及我想要建立和运行的那种组织。以这句话为标题的第 5 章探讨了开始执行此任务时可能出现的一些挑战以及如何克服这些挑战，例如招聘、培训和管理债务。
- **管理的一部分是培训你的员工。**在大公司中，这往往被忽视，因为人力资源或公司的角色是制定培训计划。这些有时可能很有价值，但通常过于通用。作为经理，请确保您正在培训您的员工，以应对他们正在从事的特定工作。诸如如何在您的特定代码库中工作、架构标准和指南是什么、什么是好的设计文档等……确保您有意设计登机程序、会议和研讨会以促进学习。

## Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim

## Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performance Technology Organizations 作者 Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble 和 Gene Kim

![](https://itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Accelerate_3D_Shingo-e1567716184319.jpg)

Accelerate is a summary of the research and learnings discovered by Dr Forsgren and her colleagues from the 2014-2017 State of DevOps report. This book is a must read for any engineering leader, as it gives you a clear outline on how to set your team up for success by investing in 24 key capabilities which will drive improvement in your teams software delivery performance.

Accelerate 是 Forsgren 博士和她的同事在 2014-2017 年 DevOps 状态报告中发现的研究和学习的总结。这本书是任何工程领导者的必读之书，因为它为您提供了一个清晰的纲要，说明如何通过投资 24 项关键功能来使您的团队取得成功，这将推动您团队软件交付性能的改进。

There are some non-surprising findings like using version control is important to team performance, and other not so obvious ones like focusing on continuous integration and software delivery performance positively impacts culture.

有一些并不令人惊讶的发现，比如使用版本控制对团队绩效很重要，而其他不那么明显的发现，比如专注于持续集成和软件交付性能，会对文化产生积极影响。

This book and the ongoing research released by Dr. Forsgren, et. Al has had a huge influence on the priorities of my team. We embraced Accelerate principles early on in the development of the Azure Sphere Security Services, and that investment has paid huge dividends over time.

这本书和 Forsgren 博士等正在进行的研究。 Al 对我团队的优先事项产生了巨大影响。我们在开发 Azure Sphere 安全服务的早期就采用了 Accelerate 原则，随着时间的推移，这项投资已经带来了巨大的回报。

## Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts. by Brene Brown 

## 敢于领导：勇敢的工作。艰难的对话。全心全意。通过布伦布朗

I’m a huge fan of Brene Brown’s work as a shame and vulnerability researcher. In October 2018 she released Dare to Lead applying her research to Leadership. This quote sums up why this book is important

我是 Brene Brown 作为耻辱和脆弱性研究员的工作的忠实粉丝。 2018 年 10 月，她发布了《敢于领导》，将她的研究应用于领导力。这句话总结了为什么这本书很重要

![](https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780399592522-us.jpg)

“There’s an old saying that I lead by now: “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” Brene Brown

“有一句老话是我现在所引领的：“人们不会在乎你知道多少，直到他们知道你有多在乎。”布伦布朗

This book dives into what it takes to become a brave and courageous leader. Spoiler a lot of it involves embracing vulnerability and living authentically, something that is far easier to say than do. The book defines vulnerability as “the emotion we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure…Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome.”

这本书深入探讨了成为勇敢和勇敢的领导者所需的条件。剧透了很多涉及拥抱脆弱和真实地生活，这说起来容易做起来难。这本书将脆弱性定义为“我们在不确定、风险和情绪暴露时期所经历的情绪……脆弱性不是输赢。当你无法控制结果时，它有勇气出现。”

One section I continually return to is the definitions of the two leadership styles: armored leadership and daring leadership. Brown’s research uncovered 16 traits for each of these leadership styles and breaks each one of them down. I highly recommend going through these periodically and checking in on your own leadership style and where there is room for growth and improvement.

我不断返回的一节是两种领导风格的定义：装甲领导和大胆领导。布朗的研究揭示了每种领导风格的 16 个特征，并将其分解为每一个。我强烈建议您定期查看这些内容，并检查您自己的领导风格以及哪里有成长和改进的空间。

Another great exercise that Brown presents in the book is one around values. She challenges readers to pick one to two core values, not ten or fifteen, because as Jim Collins said “If you have more than three priorities, you have no priorities.” Having clarity around your core values allows you to live and lead more authentically.

布朗在书中提出的另一个很好的练习是关于价值观的练习。她挑战读者选择一到两个核心价值观，而不是十个或十五个，因为正如吉姆柯林斯所说：“如果你有三个以上的优先事项，你就没有优先事项。”明确核心价值观可以让您更真实地生活和领导。

Overall this book is one of the best for dealing with the “soft skills” of leadership. How do you show up whole heartedly and help create a team that can do the same is one of the biggest challenges of taking on a management role.

总的来说，这本书是处理领导力“软技能”的最佳书籍之一。您如何全心全意地表现出来并帮助创建一个可以做到这一点的团队是担任管理角色的最大挑战之一。

## Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard

## Switch：当改变困难时如何改变事物

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QxTfW8-PL.jpg)

This book is an awesome resource for understanding the psychology and sociology behind what motivates people and how to be successful enacting change from small to epic scale. I loved this book as it provides real practical tips for how to enact change across a team or organization through researched principles and real world examples.

这本书是理解激励人们背后的心理学和社会学以及如何成功地实现从小规模到史诗规模的变革的绝佳资源。我喜欢这本书，因为它通过研究的原则和现实世界的例子提供了如何在团队或组织中实施变革的真正实用技巧。

The book starts by acknowledging that people have both emotional and rational sides, and motivating each is important for effective change. In engineering orgs we often only motivate the rationale side, because the analytical brain is all important. Sometimes we fall into the trap of “motivating” people with data, reason, and education and then wonder why these initiatives fail. But here’s the thing engineers are human beings too and we are all motivated by and susceptible to decisions made by our emotional brain.

这本书首先承认人们既有感性的一面，也有理性的一面，激励每一方面对于有效的改变都很重要。在工程组织中，我们通常只激发基本原理，因为分析大脑都很重要。有时我们会陷入用数据、推理和教育“激励”人们的陷阱，然后想知道为什么这些举措会失败。但这里的工程师也是人，我们都受到情绪大脑做出的决定的激励和影响。

The authors lay out three keys to behavior change:

作者列出了改变行为的三个关键：

- Give clear direction to reduce mental paralysis.
- Find an emotional connection to motivate people
- Shape the path. Make doing the right thing easy, by removing obstacles, modifying the environment, and building habits

- 明确方向，减少精神麻痹。
- 找到一种情感联系来激励人们
- 塑造路径。通过消除障碍、改变环境和养成习惯，让做正确的事变得容易

## Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits by James Clear

## Atomic Habits：James Clear 建立良好习惯的简单且经过验证的方法

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZJ9RjiC0L._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

This book is another favorite as it provides a lot of practical advice. The premise of this book is that small improvements accumulate into remarkable results over time. In addition building systems and processes is the most effective way to achieve your goals.

这本书是另一本书的最爱，因为它提供了许多实用的建议。本书的前提是，随着时间的推移，小的改进会积累成显着的结果。此外，构建系统和流程是实现目标的最有效方式。

Habits are simply a behavior that has been repeated so many times it becomes automatic and therefore require less time and energy. Clear spends the book describing research around habits and how to successfully create new good ones and break old bad ones. By leveraging habits we can create systems that more easily help us achieve our goals.

习惯只是一种重复很多次的行为，它变成了自动的，因此需要更少的时间和精力。克利尔用这本书描述了围绕习惯的研究，以及如何成功地创造新的好习惯并打破旧的坏习惯。通过利用习惯，我们可以创建更容易帮助我们实现目标的系统。

I love this book for two reasons, its generally applicable to many aspects of your life, and it helped me think about how to help my team establish and build good habits, or potentially break bad ones.

我喜欢这本书有两个原因，它通常适用于你生活的许多方面，它帮助我思考如何帮助我的团队建立和养成良好的习惯，或者可能打破坏习惯。
