Agile and DevOps: 7 tips for creating the right culture

敏捷和 DevOps：创建正确文化的 7 个技巧

Every organization is different and for most, the [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) journey isn't a smooth, straight line. There's no such thing as a "linear" DevOps journey. Rather, "there are many starts and stops along the way, which can kill early momentum and lead to cynicism."

每个组织都是不同的，对大多数组织而言，[DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) 之旅并不是一条平稳的直线。没有所谓的“线性”DevOps 之旅。相反，“沿途有许多起点和终点，这会扼杀早期势头并导致犬儒主义。”

As a refresher, DevOps is best defined as "a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably." (This nice concise [definition](http://www.zdnet.com/DevOpsis%20a%20set%20of%20practices%20that%20automates%20the%20processes%20between%20software%20development%20and%20IT%20teams,%20in %20order%20that%20they%20can%20build,%20test,%20and%20release%20software%20faster%20and%20more%20reliably.%20The%20concept%20of%20DevOps%20is%20founded%20on%20building%20a%20culture% 20of%20collaboration%20between%20teams%20that%20historically%20functioned%20in%20relative%20siloes.%20The%20promised%20benefits%20include%20increased%20trust,%20faster%20software%20releases,%20ability%20to%20solve%20critical%20issues %20quickly,%20and%20better%20manage%20unplanned%20work.) courtesy of the folks at Atlassian.) DevOps harnesses the creative energy of developers and channels it into cadenced releases as required by the business.

作为复习，DevOps 最好定义为“一组自动化软件开发和 IT 团队之间的流程的实践，以便他们能够更快、更可靠地构建、测试和发布软件。” （这个漂亮简洁的[定义](http://www.zdnet.com/DevOpsis%20a%20set%20of%20practices%20that%20automates%20the%20processes%20between%20software%20development%20and%20IT%20teams,%20in %20order%20that%20they%20can%20build,%20test,%20and%20release%20software%20faster%20and%20more%20reliably。%20The%20concept%20of%20DevOps%20is%20founded%20on%a20 20of％20collaboration％20between％20teams％20that％20historically％20functioned％20英寸％20relative％20siloes。％第二十条％20promised％20benefits％20include％20increased％20trust，％20faster％20software％20releases，％20ability％20to％20solve％20critical％20issues %20quickly、%20and%20better%20manage%20unplanned%20work。）由 Atlassian 的人员提供。)DevOps 利用开发人员的创造性能量，并将其引导到业务需要的有节奏的发布中。

There is one common denominator all successful DevOps enterprises have, the researchers find -- a culture of collaboration and sharing across any and all fiefdoms. "The practices with the most significant impact across the entire DevOps evolutionary journey are dependent on sharing, one of the key pillars of DevOps," the survey reports authors state. "Organizations that have small pockets of DevOps success, yet never manage to spread that success further, are stalled and can't progress to higher levels of automation and self-service. So the business impact of their DevOps success may not be felt where it matters." 

研究人员发现，所有成功的 DevOps 企业都有一个共同点——一种跨任何和所有领地的协作和共享文化。 “在整个 DevOps 演进过程中影响最显着的实践依赖于共享，这是 DevOps 的关键支柱之一，”调查报告作者指出。 “拥有少量 DevOps 成功的组织，但从未设法进一步传播成功，停滞不前，无法提升到更高水平的自动化和自助服务。因此，他们的 DevOps 成功对业务的影响可能不会被感受到很重要。”

Tellingly, those higher up in organizations often think they have DevOps in force, but those people further down in the trenches don't necessarily see it that way. "C-suite respondents were more likely to report that DevOps practices were in frequent use," the survey's authors find. For example, 64 percent of C-suite respondents believe that security teams are involved in technology design and deployment versus 39 percent at the team level. Additionally, 54 percent of C-suite respondents believe their organization automates security policy configurations versus 38 percent at the team level.

很明显，组织中的高层通常认为他们已经实施了 DevOps，但那些处于战壕中的人并不一定这么认为。调查的作者发现：“高管受访者更有可能报告说 DevOps 实践被频繁使用。”例如，64% 的最高管理层受访者认为安全团队参与了技术设计和部署，而 39% 在团队级别。此外，54% 的最高管理层受访者认为他们的组织实现了安全策略配置的自动化，而团队级别的这一比例为 38%。

The survey report's authors identified the six key stages of DevOps progression. About 11 percent fall into the most advanced category, which likely means they have highly collaborative teams functioning across their organizations, and offer tremendous self-service capabilities as well to practitioners. That means 89 percent have plenty of work to do, and 10 percent are really struggling:

调查报告的作者确定了 DevOps 进展的六个关键阶段。大约 11% 属于最高级类别，这可能意味着他们在整个组织中拥有高度协作的团队，并为从业者提供强大的自助服务功能。这意味着 89% 的人有很多工作要做，而 10% 的人真的很挣扎：

1. **Building the foundation:** "When development and operations teams -- and frequently other stakeholders, such as testing or security -- are just starting to grasp the importance of collaboration and sharing, they rapidly implement technologies and processes to facilitate sharing of ideas, metrics, knowledge, processes, and technologies."

   **建立基础：**“当开发和运营团队——通常还有其他利益相关者，如测试或安全——刚刚开始意识到协作和共享的重要性时，他们会迅速实施技术和流程以促进分享想法、指标、知识、流程和技术。”

2. **Normalizing the technology stack:** "Dev teams make a coordinated move to more agile development methods (eg, an enterprisewide Agile mandate), or a few teams organically adopting new methods for specific products or workflows. Development teams at this stage have adopted version control,which is the first step on the path to continuous integration and continuous delivery. They're also beginning to normalize their tech stacks by eliminating redundant systems, perhaps refactoring applications to work on a smaller set of operating systems."

   **规范技术堆栈：**“开发团队协调转向更敏捷的开发方法（例如，企业范围的敏捷授权），或者一些团队为特定产品或工作流有机地采用新方法。开发团队在此stage 已经采用了版本控制，这是通往持续集成和持续交付的第一步。他们也开始通过消除冗余系统来规范他们的技术堆栈，也许重构应用程序以在较小的操作系统集上工作。”

3. **Standardizing and reducing variability:** "Both dev and ops teams concentrate on reducing variance, continuing to standardize the tech stack by further reducing the number of operating systems to a single OS or OS family and building on a standard set of technologies: databases, key value stores, message queues,identity stores and more."

   **标准化和减少可变性：**“开发和运维团队都专注于减少差异，通过进一步将操作系统的数量减少到单个操作系统或操作系统系列，并在一组标准的基础上构建来继续标准化技术堆栈技术：数据库、键值存储、消息队列、身份存储等。”

4. **Expanding DevOps practices:** With new levelx of trust engendered through DevOps, "important cultural shifts can take place in the organization. For example, individual team members can gain the ability and organizational permission to do work without manual approval from outside the team, eliminating bureaucratic overhead and promoting more efficient workflows."

   **扩展 DevOps 实践：** 随着通过 DevOps 产生的新级别的信任，“重要的文化转变可以在组织中发生。例如，单个团队成员可以获得工作的能力和组织许可，而无需手动批准在团队之外，消除官僚开销并促进更高效的工作流程。”

5. **Automating infrastructure delivery:**"Systems configuration and provisioning are automated, which "resolves the issue of developer throughput outpacing operations, and therefore the ability to deploy. Automated system configuration makes it possible for ops teams to deliver systems to developers and QA that match the eventual production environment -- and deliver them faster." 

   **自动化基础设施交付：**“系统配置和供应是自动化的，它”解决了开发人员吞吐量超过操作的问题，从而解决了部署能力。自动化系统配置使运维团队能够向开发人员和 QA 交付与最终生产环境相匹配的系统——并更快地交付它们。”

6. **Providing self-service capabilities:** Infrastructure automation "catalyzes the creation of self-service more broadly throughout the organization in subsequent stages. At this stage, resources are available via self-service, and incident response is automated. With self-service capabilities, teams across the business can work at their own pace, freed from the bureaucratic overhead of manual approvals, handoffs, tickets and long wait times."

   **提供自助服务能力：**基础设施自动化“在后续阶段促进了整个组织更广泛的自助服务的创建。在这个阶段，资源通过自助服务可用，事件响应是自动化的。随着自助服务功能，整个企业的团队可以按照自己的节奏工作，从人工审批、交接、票务和漫长的等待时间等官僚开销中解放出来。”

The survey report's authors also make the following three key recommendations to move DevOps from isolated teams to a wider scale across enterprises:

**Start with the practices that are closest to production; then address processes that happen earlier in the software delivery cycle.**" We recommend starting where the pain is most acute and visible, which is typically application deployments -- the boundary between dev and ops." 

调查报告的作者还提出了以下三个关键建议，以将 DevOps 从孤立的团队转移到更广泛的企业范围内：

**从最接近生产的实践开始；然后解决软件交付周期早期发生的流程。**“我们建议从痛苦最严重和最明显的地方开始，这通常是应用程序部署——开发和运营之间的边界。”

**Encourage cross-team sharing is key to scale DevOps success.**"To ensure you can scale your early success, prioritize the building blocks that can be reused and consumed across teams,such as deployment patterns. Promoting reuse of successful patterns, enabling teams to contribute improvements to other teams' tooling, and sharing both successes and failures are all critical to expanding the other three pillars of DevOps: culture,automation and measurement.

**鼓励跨团队共享是扩大 DevOps 成功的关键。**“为了确保您可以扩大早期成功，优先考虑可以跨团队重用和使用的构建块，例如部署模式。促进成功模式的重用，使团队能够为其他团队的工具做出改进，并分享成功和失败，对于扩展 DevOps 的其他三个支柱：文化、自动化和测量都至关重要。

**Automating security policy configurations is mission-critical to reaching the highest levels of DevOps evolution.** "Highly-evolved organizations are 24 times more likely to always automate security policy configurations compared to the least evolved organizations. This finding underscores how as organizations evolve, security policy becomes a part of operations, not just an afterthought when an audit looms," the survey report's authors point out.

**自动化安全策略配置对于达到最高级别的 DevOps 发展至关重要。**“与最不发达的组织相比，高度发展的组织始终自动化安全策略配置的可能性要高 24 倍。这一发现强调了作为组织的方式发展，安全策略成为运营的一部分，而不仅仅是审计迫在眉睫的事后考虑，”调查报告的作者指出。

Here is some poetic prose one can ascribe to the DevOps movement, expressed by the report's authors:

> "Most successful DevOps journeys start as a ripple in the pond, then radiate out across the business. Individual teams see early success; that success spreads to multiple teams, then through a department, and finally out to multiple departments."

以下是报告作者所表达的一些可以归因于 DevOps 运动的诗意散文：

> “大多数成功的 DevOps 之旅始于池塘中的涟漪，然后辐射到整个业务。单个团队看到了早期的成功；这种成功传播到多个团队，然后通过一个部门，最后扩展到多个部门。”

The bottom line is that DevOps doesn't just happen overnight; it's an evolutionary process that needs to be built and mastered over a period of time, often with trial and error. Every organization has a different mix of talent, motivations, and, of course, technologies.

最重要的是，DevOps 不会在一夜之间发生；这是一个进化过程，需要在一段时间内建立和掌握，通常需要反复试验。每个组织都有不同的人才、动机，当然还有技术。
