# Software is about people, not code

# 软件是关于人的，而不是代码

Dear new developer,

亲爱的新开发者，

When I was starting out, I thought that software development was all about code. After all, that was the main thing I was working on. Well, maybe not the main thing, as I needed to know what code to write, how to interface with other code, what was the problem being solved, how to deliver it, the correctness of the code, and how it could be maintained.

刚开始时，我认为软件开发完全是关于代码的。毕竟，这是我工作的主要内容。好吧，也许不是主要的事情，因为我需要知道要编写什么代码，如何与其他代码交互，要解决的问题是什么，如何交付，代码的正确性以及如何维护。

But, the writing the code felt like the most important part of the job. It was certainly the most tangible and fundamental. After all, if the code doesn’t work, all those other things won’t matter, right?

但是，编写代码感觉是工作中最重要的部分。这当然是最有形和最根本的。毕竟，如果代码不起作用，所有其他事情都无关紧要，对吧？

This led me to focus on how to write code. I wrote up a style guide for the company. Researched new technologies. Read and commented in online forums. Learned how to decompile java bytecode to reverse engineer proprietary software. Argued about code formatting. Joined a design patterns discussion group. Attended meetups and blogged.

这让我专注于如何编写代码。我为公司写了一份风格指南。研究了新技术。在在线论坛中阅读和评论。学习了如何反编译 Java 字节码以对专有软件进行逆向工程。关于代码格式的争论。加入了一个设计模式讨论组。参加聚会并写博客。

I undertook all of these activities to be better at writing code.

我进行了所有这些活动，以便更好地编写代码。

However, I eventually learned that people were far more important for the success of a software project than code. This crystallized for me after I saw a few very interesting (to me!) codebases abandoned for lack of a market or other business flaws.

但是，我最终了解到，对于软件项目的成功而言，人比代码重要得多。在我看到一些非常有趣的（对我来说！）代码库因缺乏市场或其他业务缺陷而被放弃后，这对我来说是明确的。

This was a surprise to me, insofar as I’d assumed the code was the most important part of software development. But really:

这让我感到惊讶，因为我认为代码是软件开发中最重要的部分。但真的：

- Software and code is created for people and their purposes. It doesn’t exist on its own, isolated from human needs.
- People will use the tools or applications built with code (or, worse, they won’t). This means that they have to be bought in to what is being built and consulted about functionality.
- Most people don’t know or care about the code. (If they did, they’d likely be a developer.) They’re just trying to get something done. The most beautiful, well tested, flexible, configurable, documented, future proofed codebase that does the wrong thing is useless.

- 软件和代码是为人们及其目的而创建的。它不是独立存在的，与人类需求隔绝。
- 人们会使用用代码构建的工具或应用程序（或者，更糟糕的是，他们不会）。这意味着他们必须接受正在构建的内容并就功能进行咨询。
- 大多数人不知道或不关心代码。 （如果他们这样做了，他们很可能是一名开发人员。）他们只是想完成一些事情。最漂亮的、经过充分测试的、灵活的、可配置的、文档化的、面向未来的代码库做了错误的事情是没有用的。

At the end of the day, code is a general purpose tool, just like accounting or research and development. Code must solve real world problems of real people.

归根结底，代码是一种通用工具，就像会计或研发一样。代码必须解决真人的现实世界问题。

Sincerely,

真挚地，

Dan
