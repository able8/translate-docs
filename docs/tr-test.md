There are good reasons for keeping all the software involved up to date: Kubernetes clusters have a lot of potential for attacks due to their complex and distributed nature. On top of that, they make for attractive targets if looking for computing power. One example of attacks against Kubernetes is cryptojacking where attackers hijack clusters to mine cryptocurrency. [Tesla famously fell victim to such an attack a couple of years ago](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla) and recently such attacks have become more sophisticated as evidenced by the [Hildegard malware](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/hildegard-malware-teamtnt/).

将所有涉及的软件保持最新是有充分理由的：Kubernetes 集群由于其复杂和分布式的特性而具有很大的攻击潜力。最重要的是，如果寻找计算能力，它们会成为有吸引力的目标。 Kubernetes 攻击的一个例子是加密劫持，攻击者劫持集群以挖掘加密货币。 [特斯拉在几年前成为此类攻击的受害者](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla)，最近此类攻击变得更加复杂，[Hildegard 恶意软件](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/hildegard-malware-teamtnt/)。
