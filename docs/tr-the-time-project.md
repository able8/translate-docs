_Between 2013 and 2017 I read every issue of TIME magazine from 1923-2000–nearly 4,000 issues and 77 years worth of history. The project began as a way to track economic history and ended up being personally transformative. By reading TIME week by week over the course of multiple generations I was able to watch and feel history unfold. The experience ultimately changed the way that I live my life._

_在 2013 年和 2017 年之间，我阅读了 1923 年至 2000 年的每一期《时代》杂志——近 4,000 期和 77 年的历史。该项目最初是作为一种追踪经济历史的方式，最终成为个人变革的方式。通过在几代人的过程中逐周阅读《时代》杂志，我能够看到并感受到历史的发展。这段经历最终改变了我的生活方式。_

_These are 10 things I learned from reading every TIME Magazine in history:_

_这些是我从阅读历史上每一本时代杂志中学到的 10 件事：_

**1) Compared to the scale of history, a human lifespan is relatively brief.**  In the early days of TIME, the editors of the magazine began obituaries with the phrase “As it must to all men, Death came, last week to…” It was a reminder that eventually we all return to the same place no matter how rich, famous or powerful. We all know that life is short, but watching the cycle of birth and death for entire generations drives home just how short life really is. Over 77 years I watched multiple generations live life’s cycle. I also got to watch the major events that shaped society during those life spans. I noticed that major events happen relatively infrequently, are set in motion over very long periods of time and are driven by forces larger than any individual. A human lifespan is incredibly brief when measured against that scale.

**1) 与历史的规模相比，人类的寿命相对短暂。** 在《时代》周刊的早期，该杂志的编辑们在讣告的开头写着这样一句话：“对所有人来说，死亡都必须如此，上周到……”这提醒我们，无论多富有、多著名或多有权势，最终我们都会回到同一个地方。我们都知道生命是短暂的，但是看着几代人的生死轮回，我们就会明白生命到底有多短。在 77 年的时间里，我见证了多代人的生命循环。我还必须观看在这些生命周期中塑造社会的重大事件。我注意到重大事件发生的频率相对较低，持续时间很长，并且受到比任何个人都大的力量的推动。以这个尺度衡量，人类的寿命非常短暂。

2) **Focus on the things that matter.** We are all here for a short amount of time, so it’s critical to use that time wisely. Wealth, fame and power won’t lead to immortality. Societal memory is short and even those who make it to “the top” are eventually forgotten. This happens even faster than you might think. If you seek validation, personal achievement isn’t the place to find it. Invest in family, friends and self understanding. These are the things that will be most valuable on your journey through life.

2) **专注于重要的事情。**我们在这里的时间都很短，因此明智地利用这段时间至关重要。财富、名望和权力不会导致永生。社会记忆是短暂的，甚至那些登上“顶峰”的人最终也会被遗忘。这种情况发生的速度比您想象的还要快。如果你寻求认可，个人成就不是找到它的地方。投资于家人、朋友和自我理解。这些是您人生旅程中最有价值的东西。

3) **Savor life’s best moments.** There are a handful of times in life that everything falls into place and the collective energy of society reverberates with optimism. These times don’t last forever, so it’s important to appreciate them when you have them. In TIME these moments could often be traced back to single articles that captured the moment. One of my favorites was the Spring of 1955, when “Spring was full-blown in the U.S., and the nation’s prevailing mood seemed to be as bright as its blossoms. The people of the U.S. had never been so prosperous.”

3) **享受生活中最美好的时刻。**生活中有几次一切都井井有条，社会的集体能量因乐观而回荡。这些时间不会永远持续下去，所以当你拥有它们时，珍惜它们是很重要的。在 TIME 中，这些时刻通常可以追溯到捕捉到这一时刻的单篇文章。我最喜欢的场景之一是 1955 年的春天，“春天在美国盛开，整个国家的气氛似乎和它的花朵一样灿烂。美国人民从未如此繁荣。”

4) **The window you get into the world is relatively random.** We all get a unique window of time on this planet and the events that we see are somewhat random. The person who lived the core of their adult life from 1920-1960 saw a very different view of the world than the person who lived that life from 1940-1980 or 1980-2020. Entirely different types of people would have thrived in those windows, and someone who may have been successful from 1980-2020 may have been stymied by forces greater than themselves from 1920-1960. Winners and losers are determined in large part by chance and circumstance.

4) **你进入这个世界的窗口是相对随机的。**我们在这个星球上都有一个独特的时间窗口，我们看到的事件有些随机。与 1940-1980 或 1980-2020 年过着成年生活的人相比，在 1920-1960 年过着成年生活核心的人对世界的看法截然不同。完全不同类型的人会在这些窗口中茁壮成长，而在 1980 年至 2020 年可能取得成功的人可能在 1920 年至 1960 年期间受到比他们更大的力量的阻碍。赢家和输家在很大程度上取决于机会和环境。

5) **Just when you think you understand everything, everything will change.** When I was reading TIME I often imagined myself as someone who was born around 1900 and began a career in 1923.  By the 1970s I reached a point where it felt as if I had seen it all. I had 50 years of career “experience” and cycles were repeating. Then the 1980s happened. Economic dynamics changed and turned everything I thought I knew on its head. I learned from this experience that there are structural breaks in the way that the world works and more forces in play than anyone has the capacity to understand. 

5) **就在你认为自己了解一切的时候，一切都会改变。**当我读《时代》杂志时，我经常把自己想象成 1900 年左右出生并在 1923 年开始职业生涯的人。到了 1970 年代，我达到了这样一个地步：感觉好像我已经看到了这一切。我有 50 年的职业“经验”，而且周期在重复。然后是 1980 年代。经济动态发生了变化，颠覆了我自以为知道的一切。我从这次经历中了解到，世界运作的方式存在结构性断裂，并且发挥作用的力量超出任何人的理解能力。

6) **Human progress is the result of an ongoing relay race among generations.**  At any given moment the planet is inhabited by a group of generations sharing a common experience. As time marches forward, the baton of leadership passes from one generation to the next and eventually an entirely new group of generations inherits the Earth. Each generation benefits from the wisdom of those who came before it and guides the course of society for those who will follow. One of the more profound changes in generational leadership happened after World War II. In 1945 TIME wrote “the way of man with man changes from generation to generation, and the way of man with a machine changes sometimes overnight. The war was bringing forward a new generation of men, and with them almost a new world of machines.”

6) **人类进步是几代人之间持续接力赛跑的结果。**在任何特定时刻，地球上都居住着拥有共同经历的几代人。随着时间的推移，领导的接力棒从一代传到下一代，最终由全新的几代人继承地球。每一代人都受益于前人的智慧，并为后人指引社会的进程。世代领导的更深刻变化之一发生在第二次世界大战之后。 1945 年，TIME 写道：“人与人相处的方式代代相传，人与机器相处的方式有时会在一夜之间发生变化。战争催生了新一代的人，几乎伴随着他们的是一个新的机器世界。”

7) **America works best when we work together on big projects.** There is a school of thought that cutthroat competition leads to human progress. I found that the opposite was true. The defining event of the 20th century was World War II. The War created a mission that was so important that it rallied an entire society out of Economic Depression and organized every hand toward a common goal. The spirit of collective progress not only helped win the war, but endowed an entire generation of Americans with a sense of duty to community. This spirit carried our country for decades after the war and led to unparalleled progress in both economic output and social cohesion. We don’t need war to organize us to solve big problems. We just need to set common goals that create a shared sense of purpose.

7) **当我们在大项目上合作时，美国表现最好。**有一种观点认为，残酷的竞争会导致人类进步。我发现事实恰恰相反。 20 世纪的决定性事件是第二次世界大战。战争创造了一个如此重要的使命，它使整个社会从经济萧条中振作起来，并组织每一个人朝着一个共同的目标前进。集体进步的精神不仅帮助赢得了战争，而且赋予了整整一代美国人对社区的责任感。这种精神在战后支撑了我们的国家数十年，并在经济产出和社会凝聚力方面取得了空前的进步。我们不需要战争来组织我们解决大问题。我们只需要设定共同的目标，创造共同的使命感。

8) **It’s critical that we protect our institutions.** Strong Institutions have much longer lifespans than any single generation or set of generations. Because of this, they provide stability and guidance for subsequent generations. It’s critical that we protect and grow our institutions as touch points between generations and epochs. Beware of leaders who seek control of these institutions for personal enrichment and self aggrandizement. Institutions that have been built over the course of centuries can decline over the course of years. Seek leaders who are humble stewards and recognize that they are protecting something that is much greater than themselves.

8) **我们保护我们的制度至关重要。** 强大的制度比任何一代人或几代人的寿命都要长得多。正因为如此，它们为后代提供稳定性和指导。至关重要的是，我们要保护和发展我们的机构，将其作为代际和时代之间的接触点。提防那些寻求控制这些机构以谋取个人财富和自我膨胀的领导人。几个世纪以来建立起来的机构可能会随着岁月的流逝而衰落。寻找谦逊的管家领导者，并认识到他们正在保护比他们自己更伟大的事物。

9) **Over the short term policy matters. Over the long term science matters.** In 1999 TIME named Albert Einstein the Person of the Century. It was the perfect choice. The three finalists for the honor were Roosevelt, Gandhi and Einstein, but the magazine ultimately chose Einstein because in the end “politics is for the moment. An equation is for eternity.” In the short term government has the greatest impact on economic cycles, but over the long term science and technology define the productivity and standard of living of humanity. We should invest in science because this is an investment in the progress of humanity and provides a worthy mission to pursue while we spend our time on this Earth. 

9) **短期政策问题。从长远来看，科学很重要。** 1999 年，时代杂志将阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦评为世纪人物。这是完美的选择。该荣誉的三位决赛选手是罗斯福、甘地和爱因斯坦，但该杂志最终选择了爱因斯坦，因为归根结底“政治是为了当下。等式是永恒的。”从短期来看，政府对经济周期的影响最大，但从长远来看，科学和技术决定了人类的生产力和生活水平。我们应该投资于科学，因为这是对人类进步的投资，并为我们在地球上度过的时光提供了值得追求的使命。

10) **We all share a small world.** In TIME’s Person of the Century issue it also noted that “Einstein taught the greatest humility of all: that we are but a speck in an unfathomably large universe. The more we gain insight into its mysterious forces, cosmic and atomic, the more reason we have to be humble. And the more we harness the huge power of these forces, the more such humility becomes an imperative.” This was the most important takeaway from observing the passage of time over the course of three quarters of a century. We don’t fully understand why or how we are here but we share our short time on this planet with billions of other souls who are each trying to make sense of the same world in their own way. The need for compassion, empathy and humility is so much greater than the need for competition and conquest.

10) **我们共享一个小世界。**在《时代周刊》的世纪人物一期中，它还指出“爱因斯坦教导了所有人中最大的谦逊：我们只是一个深不可测的大宇宙中的一个斑点。我们越深入了解它的神秘力量，宇宙和原子，我们就越有理由保持谦虚。我们越是利用这些力量的巨大力量，这种谦逊就越是势在必行。”这是观察四分之三个世纪的时间流逝的最重要的收获。我们不完全理解我们为什么或如何在这里，但我们与数十亿其他灵魂分享我们在这个星球上的短暂时间，每个人都试图以自己的方式理解同一个世界。对同情、同理心和谦逊的需求远大于对竞争和征服的需求。

_I first set out to read every issue of TIME with this spirit of conquest, but the experience changed me. I learned that these goals can be personally and societally destructive and that victory won’t give you the wealth you seek. As a result I will spend the rest of my life treasuring every moment that I have here with the people that I love. And I will spend my working hours building and supporting strong institutions that promote human understanding._

_我最初是带着这种征服精神开始阅读每一期时代周刊的，但这段经历改变了我。我了解到这些目标可能对个人和社会具有破坏性，而且胜利不会给你想要的财富。因此，我将用我的余生来珍惜我在这里与我所爱的人在一起的每一刻。我将把我的工作时间用于建立和支持促进人类理解的强大机构。_

_I imagine that anyone who lives a long life might draw similar conclusions about what is and isn’t important, and I feel that it is a gift to have been given this perspective at a relatively young age. Ultimately, by reading every issue of TIME I learned the value of time, which is, by far, our most precious commodity._

_我想任何一个长寿的人都可能会得出类似的结论，什么是重要的，什么不重要，我觉得在相对年轻的时候就拥有这种观点是一种天赋。最终，通过阅读每一期《时代》杂志，我了解了时间的价值，这是迄今为止我们最宝贵的商品。_
