## The Book in Three Sentences

## 三句话的书

Behavioral problems, not technical skills, are what separate the great from the near great. Incredible results can come from practicing basic behaviors like saying thank you, listening well, thinking before you speak, and apologizing for your mistakes. The first step to change is wanting to change.

行为问题，而不是技术技能，是区分伟人与近伟人的原因。令人难以置信的结果可以来自练习基本行为，例如说谢谢、好好倾听、说话前先思考以及为自己的错误道歉。改变的第一步是想要改变。

## 是什么让你在这里不会让你在那里摘要

This is my book summary of What Got You Here Won't Get You There by Marshall Goldsmith. My notes are informal and often contain quotes from the book as well as my own thoughts. This summary also includes key lessons and important passages from the book.

这是我对马歇尔·戈德史密斯 (Marshall Goldsmith) 所著的《什么让你在这不会让你在那里》的书摘要。我的笔记是非正式的，通常包含书中的引述以及我自己的想法。该摘要还包括本书的主要课程和重要段落。

- The higher you go in an organization, the more your suggestions become interpreted as orders.
- Getting praise can be dangerous because it becomes easy to delude yourself when all you hear are positive things.
- Delusional self-confidence causes you to resist change.
- You can't control the outcome, but why wouldn't you want to try to control what you can? Even if the cards are stacked against you in life your best bet is to try your hardest.

- 您在组织中的级别越高，您的建议就越会被解释为命令。
- 得到表扬可能很危险，因为当你听到的都是积极的事情时，很容易自欺欺人。
- 妄想的自信导致你抵制改变。
- 你无法控制结果，但你为什么不想尝试控制你能控制的呢？即使生活中对你不利，你最好的选择就是尽你最大的努力。

- Successful people believe they are in control. They don't see themselves as victims of the world.
- Lottery ticket players: serious lottery players think success is random. Successful people think success is within their control and thus don't play the lottery. Both mindsets are delusional in their own way, but the successful approach seems to work better overall.
- People will only do something and change when it is in their own best interest and aligns with our values.

- 成功人士相信他们处于控制之中。他们不认为自己是世界的受害者。
- 彩票玩家：认真的彩票玩家认为成功是随机的。成功的人认为成功在他们的掌控之中，因此不会去买彩票。两种心态都有自己的妄想症，但成功的方法似乎总体上更有效。
- 人们只会在符合自己的最佳利益并符合我们的价值观的情况下做某事并做出改变。

- The four drivers of self-interest: money, power, status, popularity.
- Smart people know what to do. They need to know what to stop.
- Create a To-Stop list rather than a To-Do list.
- Not all behavior is good or bad. Some behaviors are simply neutral.

- 自我利益的四个驱动因素：金钱、权力、地位、人气。
- 聪明的人知道该怎么做。他们需要知道该停止什么。
- 创建待办事项列表而不是待办事项列表。
- 并非所有行为都是好是坏。有些行为只是中性的。

- The fallacy of adding too much value is that by adding value you kill the ownership of other peoples ideas. When you add to the idea it no longer feels like it is their idea.
- When getting feedback of any type, positive or negative, accept it from a neutral place and say, “Thank you.” If you don't reply with a judgmental comment, you can't get into an argument.
- The question to ask yourself when making a destructive or critical comment about someone is not, “Is it true?” But, “Is it worth it?”
- Don't tell people how smart you are. Nobody gives a damn.

- 增加太多价值的谬误是，通过增加价值，你扼杀了其他人的想法的所有权。当你加入这个想法时，它不再觉得这是他们的想法。
- 当收到任何类型的反馈时，无论是正面的还是负面的，从一个中立的地方接受它并说：“谢谢。”如果你不以判断性的评论来回复，你就不能陷入争论。
- 在对某人发表破坏性或批评性评论时要问自己的问题不是，“这是真的吗？”但是这值得吗？”
- 不要告诉别人你有多聪明。没有人在乎。

- Withholding information is a problem for me when I don't communicate well. If you don't communicate what is going on it feels like you're keeping people in the dark. That annoys people.
- Create a list of people you should give recognition to and then review that list each week to see if you should send someone praise.
- Give away ALL the credit.

- 当我不能很好地沟通时，隐瞒信息对我来说是一个问题。如果你不传达正在发生的事情，感觉就像是在让人们蒙在鼓里。这让人们很恼火。
- 创建一份你应该表扬的人的名单，然后每周查看这份名单，看看你是否应该给某人表扬。
- 放弃所有的功劳。

- Clinging to the past: “Many people enjoy living in the past, especially if going back there lets them blame someone else for anything that's gone wrong in their lives. That's when clinging to the past becomes an interpersonal problem… When we make excuses, we are blaming someone or something beyond our control as the reason for our failure. Anyone but ourselves.” When we talk about the past it is NOT about change. It is about understanding. And often about blaming others.

- 执着于过去：“许多人喜欢活在过去，特别是如果回到过去让他们将生活中的任何错误归咎于他人。那是当执着于过去成为人际关系问题的时候……当我们找借口时，我们将失败的原因归咎于某人或我们无法控制的事情。除了我们自己以外的任何人。”当我们谈论过去时，它不是关于改变。这是关于理解。并且经常责备他人。

- Just say “Thank You” to more comments rather than making a bigger fuss about things. We often have issues with accepting compliments.
- Hearing people out does not make you dumber. So listen and say thank you.
- Gratitude is not a limited resource. Express your thanks more often.
- People who think they can do no wrong usually can't admit they are ever wrong. Which, paradoxically, makes you more wrong. Owning up to your mistakes is essential.

- 只需对更多评论说“谢谢”，而不是对事情大惊小怪。我们经常在接受赞美时遇到问题。
- 听别人说并不会让你变笨。所以听着说谢谢。
- 感恩不是有限的资源。更频繁地表达你的感谢。
- 认为自己不会做错的人通常不会承认自己错了。矛盾的是，这会让你更加错误。承认自己的错误至关重要。

- Your personality is not fixed and improvement does not require you to become a radically different person. You don't have to change your whole life, just improve one tiny trait.
- Goal obsession is the blindness of goal pursuit at the expense of more important things.
- You should feel no shame if your pursuit of a difficult goal fails.
- Goal obsession is not a flaw, it is a creator of flaws. 

- 你的个性不是固定的，改进不需要你成为一个完全不同的人。你不必改变你的整个生活，只需要改善一个微小的特质。
- 目标痴迷是对目标追求的盲目性，以牺牲更重要的事情为代价。
- 如果你追求一个困难的目标失败了，你不应该感到羞耻。
- 目标痴迷不是缺陷，它是缺陷的创造者。

- Princeton theology students research study and the story of the Good Samaritan. Goal obessions: we are so focus on shortsighted goals and the task in front of us that we miss the bigger point. Use this as a jumping off point for talking about goals in life. Is working really the point?

- 普林斯顿神学学生研究性学习和好撒玛利亚人的故事。目标痴迷：我们太专注于短视的目标和摆在我们面前的任务，以至于我们错过了更重要的点。以此作为讨论人生目标的起点。工作真的是重点吗？

- Main lesson: you can do a lot worse than questioning your flaws. We often get so defensive about these things, but what do we really have to lose? Usually, very little.
- Forgiveness means letting go of the hope for a better past.
- The higher you go the more your problems are behavioral. Interpersonal behavior is the difference between being great and near great.
- Knowing the answer to, “How do you feel about me?” does not matter when it comes to getting better. What matters is, “How can I get better?”
- Apologize, apologize, apologize. Just step up and make the apologies you need to make.

- 主要教训：你可以做得比质疑自己的缺陷更糟糕。我们经常对这些事情变得如此防御，但我们真的必须失去什么？通常，很少。
- 宽恕意味着放弃对美好过去的希望。
- 你走得越高，你的行为问题就越多。人际行为是伟大和接近伟大之间的区别。
- 知道答案，“你对我感觉如何？”什么时候变得更好并不重要。重要的是，“我怎样才能变得更好？”
- 道歉，道歉，道歉。只要站出来，做出你需要做出的道歉。

- When you make an apology say, “I'm sorry. I'll try to do better.” And then shut up. Don't try to justify it.
- Frances Hesselbein, CEO of the Girl Scouts. Claimed to be greatest executive by Peter Drucker.
- When you listen to someone make them feel like they are the only person in the room. Devote your attention to them.
- We can't change for the long-run without following up. Follow up shows your colleagues that you care about getting better and that you're taking the process seriously.

- 当你道歉时说，“对不起。我会努力做得更好。”然后闭嘴。不要试图为它辩解。
- Frances Hesselbein，女童子军首席执行官。被彼得·德鲁克称为最伟大的高管。
- 当你听某人说话时，让他们觉得他们是房间里唯一的人。把你的注意力集中在他们身上。
- 从长远来看，我们不能不跟进就改变。跟进向您的同事表明您关心变得更好，并且您正在认真对待这个过程。
