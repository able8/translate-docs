# What I Learned From Bombing a Technical Interview

# 我从轰炸技术面试中学到的东西

12 Nov 2020



So... I embarrassingly bombed a technical interview yesterday. It was... BAD. In all honesty, this interview had the potential to be great. Both people interviewing me were very calm and kind. And I had the opportunity to show off my own project and add a new feature to it. If you've ever done a technical interview before, you know this is one of the best case scenarios (aside from no technical interview at all). And yet, I totally blew it.

所以......我昨天尴尬地轰炸了一次技术面试。这不怎么样。老实说，这次采访很有潜力。采访我的两个人都非常冷静和善良。我有机会展示我自己的项目并为其添加新功能。如果您以前做过技术面试，就会知道这是最好的情况之一（除了根本没有技术面试）。然而，我完全搞砸了。

I rambled A LOT. I forgot key terminology. When I was adding a new feature to my web app, I forgot key steps and I explained what I was doing poorly. I ended up ending the interview early because I was getting so stressed out and nervous.

我闲逛了很多。我忘记了关键术语。当我向我的 Web 应用程序添加新功能时，我忘记了关键步骤，并解释了我做得不好的地方。我最终提前结束了面试，因为我太紧张了。

This was a position I _really_ wanted. I was really disappointed in myself and I felt like trash to be completely honest. I was kind of thinking about switching professions for a minute too😂 But, I want to look back on this experience and point out some of things I could have done better and will do better next time. So if you have a technical interview coming up, this one's for you!

这是我_真的_想要的职位。我真的对自己很失望，说实话，我觉得自己像个垃圾。我也有点想转行了😂但是，我想回顾一下这段经历并指出一些我本可以做得更好的事情，下次会做得更好。因此，如果您即将进行技术面试，那么这就是为您准备的！

## 1\. GET ENOUGH SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE

## 1\.前一天晚上睡够了

This is number one for a reason. I pretty much pulled an all nighter the night before. I was practicing what I was going to say, preparing for an upcoming workshop I'm hosting, and watching Marvel movies. Basically, a recipe for disaster.

这是有原因的。前一天晚上我几乎整夜都熬夜。我正在练习我要说的话，为即将举办的研讨会做准备，并观看漫威电影。基本上，灾难的秘诀。

I thought I was in high school again when I used to pull all nighters and take a test the next morning and still get a near perfect score. My brain doesn't work like that anymore. So I will _never_ be doing that again. I'm convinced this is the main reason why my explanations were all over the place and pretty much nonsensical.

我以为我又回到了高中，当时我常常熬夜，第二天早上参加考试，但仍然获得接近满分的成绩。我的大脑不再那样工作了。所以我_永远_不会再这样做了。我相信这是我的解释到处都是并且几乎是荒谬的主要原因。

So make sure you get enough sleep before your interview! In my case, I probably would have been better off sleeping than practicing like I had done. Without sleep, all that practice was pretty much useless.

所以面试前一定要保证充足的睡眠！就我而言，睡觉可能比像以前那样练习更好。没有睡眠，所有这些练习都毫无用处。

## 2\. Do a mock interview with a friend

## 2\.和朋友做一次模拟面试

I'm a huge believer in mock interviews. I've done one for almost every technical interview I've had... except for this one. I'm positive that walking through my code with a trusted friend or colleague would have helped me _immensely_.

我非常相信模拟面试。我几乎为每一次技术面试都做了一次……除了这次。我确信与值得信赖的朋友或同事一起浏览我的代码会对我有_巨大的_帮助。

I wasn't sure what feature I should build to impress the interviewers so I was really scattered. I was jumping between two features and I'm sure that didn't look good. If I had practiced with a mock interview, I would've asked for feedback and seen what feature I should have implemented during the interview. A mock interview also would have helped me to fine tune my explanations. So yes, next time I _will_ be doing a mock interview with someone.

我不确定我应该建立什么功能来给面试官留下深刻印象，所以我真的很分散。我在两个功能之间跳来跳去，我确定这看起来不太好。如果我通过模拟面试进行练习，我会要求反馈并查看我应该在面试期间实施的功能。模拟面试也会帮助我调整我的解释。所以是的，下次我_将_与某人进行模拟面试。

## 3\. Take notes before the interview

## 3. 面试前做笔记

The more I think about this interview, the more I realize how chaotic my brain was at the time (see point number one). Now that I think about it, it's actually kind of funny. Just a few minutes before the interview started, I thought it might be a good idea to write down the steps I needed to follow to add my desired feature. This was a good idea I think except I wrote them on sticky notes and the sticky notes somehow got scattered out of order all over my desk. Can you feel the chaos??

我越是想这次采访，我就越意识到我当时的大脑是多么的混乱（见第一点）。现在回想起来，真的有点好笑。就在面试开始前几分钟，我认为写下添加所需功能所需遵循的步骤可能是个好主意。我认为这是一个好主意，只是我把它们写在便签上，而便签不知何故乱七八糟地散落在我的桌子上。你能感觉到混乱吗？？

This obviously made things worse for me since I got so flustered that I completely blanked on what I was supposed to be doing. And the sticky notes were all over the place and I couldn't get them back in order. Now I know that it's probably best to either write them down on a sheet of paper or type the steps out in a markdown file.

这显然让我的事情变得更糟，因为我非常慌张，以至于我完全不知道我应该做什么。粘滞便笺到处都是，我无法按顺序将它们放回原处。现在我知道最好将它们写在一张纸上或在降价文件中输入步骤。

## 4\. Talk a LOT

## 4. 聊了很多

This usually isn't very hard for me because I'm a naturally talkative person and I actually enjoy talking through my code. This time was different though. I couldn't get my thoughts straight (again, see number one) and I had a lot of awkward pauses. For technical interviews, it's best to just voice you're thoughts even if you're not exactly sure what's going on.

这对我来说通常不是很难，因为我是一个天生健谈的人，而且我实际上很喜欢通过我的代码进行交谈。不过这次不一样。我无法直截了当地思考（再次，请参阅第一）并且我有很多尴尬的停顿。对于技术面试，最好只是表达你的想法，即使你不确定发生了什么。

## 5\. Use tons of pseudocode 

## 5. 使用大量伪代码

Again, this is something I LOVE to do. Using pseudocode helps me to get my thought process straight and point out flawed logic quickly. It's also a great way to show your interviewer how you think and approach problems. I didn't use pseudocode enough during this interview but I'll make sure to utilize this technique during my next one.

同样，这是我喜欢做的事情。使用伪代码帮助我理清思路，快速指出有缺陷的逻辑。这也是向面试官展示您如何思考和解决问题的好方法。在这次采访中我没有使用足够多的伪代码，但我会确保在下一次采访中使用这种技术。

## 6\. Don't drink coffee before the interview!

## 6\.面试前不要喝咖啡！

**Disclaimer: this is purely my personal preference so please feel free to disregard this completely** This is something that might surprise you. But I tend to get a little jittery whenever I drink coffee. So whenever I have to do something that's nerve racking, I make sure to avoid coffee at all cost. I did not do that for this interview. I drank coffee because I hadn't slept and I thought it would help. But it just made me super jumpy and of course, I got the jitters. This made me more nervous and that made me panic. So yeah, as you can imagine, it was a disaster. Note to self: don't drink coffee before an interview.

**免责声明：这纯粹是我的个人喜好，所以请完全无视这一点** 这可能会让您感到惊讶。但是每当我喝咖啡时，我都会有点紧张。因此，每当我不得不做一些令人伤脑筋的事情时，我都会确保不惜一切代价避免喝咖啡。我在这次采访中没有这样做。我喝咖啡是因为我还没睡，我认为这会有所帮助。但这让我非常神经质，当然，我也很紧张。这让我更加紧张，这让我感到恐慌。所以是的，正如你想象的那样，这是一场灾难。自我提醒：面试前不要喝咖啡。

## 7\. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself

## 7\.不要给自己太大压力

This one is hard. Most of us need to work and if you’re out of work, that makes any job interview very high pressure. For me, I really, really wanted this job. I was excited about the role and the people I would get to work with. So I put a lot of pressure on myself to impress and perform well. But all that pressure made me do the opposite. This is a tough one to follow but I’m going to try not to do this next time. I’m still figuring out how to get pass this reaction I have to any opportunity I’m excited about. If you have any tips, please share!!

这个很难。我们大多数人都需要工作，如果你失业了，那会让任何求职面试的压力都很大。对我来说，我真的非常想要这份工作。我对这个角色和我将与之共事的人感到兴奋。所以我给自己施加了很大的压力，要给人留下深刻印象并表现出色。但所有这些压力都让我反其道而行之。这是一个很难遵循的方法，但我下次会尽量不这样做。我仍在想办法让我对任何令我感到兴奋的机会产生这种反应。如果您有任何建议，请分享！！

As you can see, a lot of my mistakes stemmed from lack of sleep. I'm not going to say that I'm the best at technical interviews. But I've never performed like this. There are some things I know how to do well and I just didn't do them this time around. And I'm 100% positive it's because I didn't get enough sleep. So if there's one thing you take away from this, it should be this: **Sleep is very important! So please try to get enough rest before your interview!!**

正如你所看到的，我的很多错误都源于睡眠不足。我不会说我最擅长技术面试。但我从来没有这样表现过。有些事情我知道如何做好，但这次我没有做。我 100% 肯定这是因为我没有得到足够的睡眠。因此，如果您从中获得了一件事，则应该是：**睡眠非常重要！所以请尽量在面试前充分休息！！**

Now, to be clear, I'm not writing this article to overly criticize myself. Thinking about what happened still stings but I'm done beating myself up about it. I'm sure I'll think about this some day and laugh. But I'm writing this now to learn from the situation and maybe even help someone else! So please learn from my mistakes!

现在，要明确的是，我写这篇文章并不是为了过度批评自己。想想发生的事情仍然很刺痛，但我已经为此自责了。我相信有一天我会想到这个并笑出声来。但我现在写这篇文章是为了从这种情况中学习，甚至可能帮助别人！所以请从我的错误中吸取教训！

Lots of lovely people have been kind enough to give me some technical interview tips. I plan on putting all those together in a more comprehensive blog post! So stay tuned for that. Thanks for reading!

很多可爱的人都很好地给了我一些技术面试技巧。我计划将所有这些放在一个更全面的博客文章中！所以请继续关注。谢谢阅读！
