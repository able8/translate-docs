## HR is not your friend, and other things I think you should know

## HR 不是你的朋友，我认为你应该知道的其他事情

2021 年 1 月 17 日，星期日

HR is not your friend. HR is there to support the company. If you are
not the company, they are not going to be there to support you.

HR 不是你的朋友。 HR 在那里为公司提供支持。如果你是
不是公司，他们不会在那里支持你。

HR boils down to paid witnesses in some cases. It changes it from a
"you said, the boss said" thing to two-on-one (or worse). They just pay
attention and maybe give a sworn statement down the road if things turn
truly nasty.

在某些情况下，人力资源归结为付费证人。它从一个
“你说，老板说”的事情要二对一（或更糟）。他们只要付钱
注意，如果情况好转，可能会在路上发表一份宣誓声明
真的很恶心。

Who else operates like that? Mall cops and security guards. They don't
have guns. They have phones and notepads. So, it's really mall cops,
security guards... and HR.

还有谁这样操作？商场警察和保安。他们不
有枪。他们有电话和记事本。所以，这真的是商场警察，
保安……和人力资源。

The only time I ever had a conversation with HR even marginally improve
something is when I was on the "side" of the company and was reporting
something involving personnel to them so they could keep the company
out of trouble.

我唯一一次与 HR 交谈甚至略有改善
事情是当我站在公司的“一边”并报告时
一些涉及人员的事情，以便他们可以保留公司
摆脱困境。

That is, person A did something evil to person B, and I was person A's
nominal supervisor. I was required (CA law!) to report it to HR, and I
did, and that was that. HR yelled at person A while I watched. That's
about how it went.

也就是说，A对B做了坏事，而我是A的
名义上的主管。我被要求（加州法律！）向人力资源部报告，我
做到了，就是这样。在我看着的时候，HR 对着 A 大喊大叫。那是
关于它是如何进行的。

If person B had reported it to HR, nothing probably would have happened.

如果 B 将其报告给 HR，则可能什么都不会发生。

This is clear because person B DID in fact report something to them a
different time for someone else, and nothing happened to the evil
person. Why? Because this time the evil person was someone on the
company's side (management), and therefore is going to be somewhat
protected by default.

这很清楚，因为 B 人实际上向他们报告了一些事情
别人的时间不同，邪恶什么也没发生
人。为什么？因为这一次邪恶的人是有人在
公司方面（管理层），因此将在某种程度上
默认保护。

"Oh, you're just imagining it". "Oh, it didn't happen". That kind of
stuff.

“哦，你只是想象而已。” “哦，它没有发生”。那种
东西。

Expert gaslighters, they are. What really makes me wonder is how the
people keep doing these jobs. Many of them are in the very classes that
get abused by other people regularly. How can you honestly keep doing
that job when you are just enabling the abusers?

专业的煤气灯，他们是。真正让我想知道的是
人们继续做这些工作。他们中的许多人都属于
经常被其他人虐待。你怎么能诚实地继续做
当你只是为施虐者提供帮助时，那份工作？

Side note: person B's report to HR about this evil person came up in
person B's "calibration session", which is part of performance reviews
at that company. Some quick-witted manager type promptly spoke up and
stopped that particular conversation thread. I was there and heard it
myself.

旁注：B 人向 HR 报告了这个邪恶的人
B 人的“校准会议”，这是绩效评估的一部分
在那个公司。一些机智的经理类型立即发言并
停止了那个特定的对话线程。我在那里听到了
我。

So let's talk about performance reviews now.

所以现在让我们谈谈绩效评估。

Performance reviews are a joke because almost nobody knows how to
measure anyone else's effectiveness. They are just a continuation of
the same popularity contests you thought you left behind from middle
school, high school, and maybe even your college/university days if you
were able to attend such places. The reasoning is simple enough: the
people doing the assessments are still back in that mindset, so it's
unsurprising that they bring it forward into reviews.

绩效评估是个笑话，因为几乎没有人知道如何
衡量其他人的有效性。他们只是一个延续
你认为你从中间落后的同样受欢迎的比赛
学校，高中，甚至你的大学/大学日子，如果你
能够参加这样的地方。道理很简单：
做评估的人仍然回到那种心态，所以它是
不足为奇的是，他们将其提交到评论中。

Accordingly, hiring reviews are just about as random as performance
reviews. Look at it another way - a performance review is based on
having worked with someone for an extended period of time, and it's
still frequently used to prop up the cronies and knock down anyone who
doesn't spout the party line. Given that an interview is based on a
handful of phone calls and maybe a day of focused interviews, is
it so surprising that they are also broken?

因此，招聘评估与绩效几乎一样随机
评论。换个角度看——绩效评估是基于
和某人一起工作了很长一段时间，而且
仍然经常用来支持亲信并击倒任何
不喷党的路线。鉴于面试是基于
几个电话，也许一天的重点采访，是
这么奇怪，它们也坏了？

Really, most hiring reviews come down to: did this person resemble the
other people we already have here. Never mind if the reason the place
is broken is because they keep hiring the same sort of person and really
need to shift. It's like, how well do they blend in with our \*idea\* of
what it takes to do the job?

真的，大多数招聘评论归结为：这个人是否像
我们这里已经有其他人了。别介意这个地方的原因
坏了是因为他们一直在雇佣同一类人，而且真的
需要转移。就像，它们与我们的\*想法\* 融合得如何
完成这项工作需要什么？

Let me say this another way: I have empirically determined that very few
company situations actually give a shit about whether someone is bad at
their job. It doesn't matter how much data you produce or stories you
can come up with. If it doesn't fit the narrative someone else wants to
push, nothing will happen to them. Also, if \*you\* push hard enough to
"fix" the situation, guess what? YOU become the problem.

让我换一种方式说：我凭经验确定很少
公司的情况实际上在乎某人是否擅长
他们的工作。你产生多少数据或故事并不重要
可以拿出来。如果它不符合其他人想要的叙述
推，他们什么也不会发生。此外，如果 \*you\* 用力推到
“修复”情况，你猜怎么着？你成了问题。

One exception to this that I've found is when someone already has
plans for getting rid of someone and just needs the "ammo". At that
point, they will quickly become your "friend" in order to get all of
the dirt on that person, and then once the deed is done, it'll be like
you never existed to them.

我发现的一个例外是当有人已经
摆脱某人的计划，只需要“弹药”。那时
点，他们会很快成为你的“朋友”，以获得所有的
那个人身上的污垢，然后一旦行为完成，它就会像
你对他们来说从未存在过。

Alternatively, if you can prove the person is harming the company
somehow, then yeah, they will probably gang up on them and that'll be
that. But, again, it has to be something visible that lines up with
whatever their party line may be. "Sits there moistening a chair and
never does anything useful" is not sufficient. It has to be something
really nasty like "exposes the company to lawsuits". THEN they start
paying attention. 

或者，如果您能证明此人正在损害公司
不知何故，是的，他们可能会联合起来对付他们，那就是
那。但是，同样，它必须是可见的，与
无论他们的派对路线是什么。 “坐在那里打湿椅子，
从不做任何有用的事情”是不够的。它必须是某种东西
真的很讨厌，比如“让公司面临诉讼”。然后他们开始
关注。

Imagine every bad "evil villain" trope you've ever witnessed by watching
crappy TV dramas or bad movies. They're not that much of a stretch.
Some of those screenwriters probably worked in companies like this
before putting pen to paper.

想象一下你看过的每一个坏的“邪恶的恶棍”比喻
糟糕的电视剧或糟糕的电影。他们并没有那么牵强。
其中一些编剧可能在这样的公司工作过
在把笔放在纸上之前。

In terms of weirdly broken people, there are many different types. If
you are the sort who honestly expects everyone to be reasonable, honest
and generally agreeable, prepare to be shocked. The longer it takes you
to realize this, the longer the most evil ones will take advantage of
you.

就奇形怪状的人而言，有很多不同的类型。如果
你是那种真诚地希望每个人都理智、诚实的人
大体上是可以接受的，准备好被震惊吧。你需要的时间越长
意识到这一点，最邪恶的人会利用的时间越长
你。

One type you should be aware of is the person who will change their
story from day to day in order to "win" the "argument" that's currently
underway. If you have a decent memory for conversations, you might
think you are losing your mind, because surely this person was FOR this
last week, but now they are AGAINST it?

您应该注意的一种类型是将改变他们的人
为了“赢得”当前的“争论”，每天都在讲述故事
进行。如果你有良好的对话记忆，你可能会
认为你正在失去理智，因为这个人肯定是为了这个
上周，但现在他们反对吗？

It's not because they decided to change their mind - people are
certainly allowed (and expected) to shift based on new information.
It's just so they win this time. Come back to them a few days later,
and they might be in yet another spot.

这不是因为他们决定改变主意——人们是
当然允许（并预期）根据新信息进行转变。
只是这次他们赢了。几天后回来找他们，
他们可能在另一个地方。

Imagine working with a person like this when you're trying to get
something done that involves their team acting like a gatekeeper. You
get the approval from them on doing something one way, then plow a bunch
of time into developing it, and then when it's time to deliver things,
that same person gets in the way and stops the whole affair.

想象一下，当您试图获得
所做的事情涉及他们的团队像看门人一样。你
得到他们的批准，以一种方式做某事，然后犁一堆
开发它的时间，然后什么时候交付东西，
同一个人妨碍并阻止了整个事情。

This really happens in some isolated cases, and it's maddening as hell.
In those situations, you really come to appreciate your chat logs. Of
course, if they have been sticking to in-person chats (in normal times,
not now, obviously) or phone/video calls, good luck! Those usually
aren't logged. Wiretapping laws are funny that way.

这种情况确实发生在一些孤立的情况下，而且令人发狂。
在这些情况下，您真的会很感激您的聊天记录。的
当然，如果他们一直坚持面对面聊天（在正常情况下，
显然不是现在）或电话/视频通话，祝你好运！那些通常
没有记录。这样的窃听法很有趣。

...

I have another thought here and can't come up with a decent segue so
we'll just do a needle-scratch and jump right into it. This one is that
sometimes the "full bird" higher-ups at a company are in fact powerless.
It doesn't matter if their title is VP or SVP or CTO or whatever. When
the rubber meets the road, they may be a figurehead, unable to make
things actually stick.

我在这里有另一个想法，无法想出一个像样的转场所以
我们会做一个针划痕，然后直接跳进去。这个是那个
有时，公司的“全鸟”高层实际上是无能为力的。
不管他们的头衔是 VP、SVP 还是 CTO 或其他什么。什么时候
橡胶遇到路，他们可能是傀儡，无法制造
东西居然粘住了。

I learned about a situation like this from someone who's been deeply
involved with any number of companies and wound up at one of those
high-level positions at one later in their career. They were supposed
to be the final word on the technical details of what went out the door.
This person is the real deal, incidentally. They know the ins and outs
of the whole situation, and was exactly who you'd want in that position.

我从一个深有体会的人那里了解到这样的情况
涉及任何数量的公司，并在其中一家公司结束
在他们职业生涯的后期担任高级职位。他们应该
成为关于出门的技术细节的最终决定。
顺便说一句，这个人是真正的交易。他们知道来龙去脉
整个情况，正是你想要的那个位置。

In that role, the company gave them the power to say "this way and not
that way", but also put this person in the spot of being responsible
for whatever happened as a result. It was on them to make good
decisions that made sense in terms of the existing product line, the
ones under development, and the stuff they wanted to do.

在那个角色中，公司赋予他们权力说“这样而不是
那样”，但也把这个人放在负责的地方
无论结果如何。他们应该做好
就现有产品线而言有意义的决策，
正在开发的，以及他们想做的事情。

Then, one day, one of those decisions came to a head and needed the
final call from this person. They made the call to go one particular
way since it made better engineering sense with the work they were
already doing. What the other people wanted would add far more variance
to their eng work and would generally be incompatible with the existing
stuff. There was no benefit to it, other than some other person
"getting their way".

然后，有一天，其中一个决定浮出水面，需要
此人的最后电话。他们打电话去一个特别的
方式，因为它对他们所做的工作具有更好的工程意义
已经在做。其他人想要的会增加更多的差异
对他们的工程工作，通常与现有的不兼容
东西。除了其他人之外，没有任何好处
“得到他们的方式”。

It came down to this: either this person was in fact their head honcho
of whatever it was, and they were making that decision, or they were
not. The company said... you are not. It was as simple as that.

归结为：要么这个人实际上是他们的首领
无论是什么，他们正在做出那个决定，或者他们
不是。公司说……你不是。就这么简单。

They didn't stick around after that. Would you?

在那之后，他们没有留下来。你会？

So, if you've ever thought that jumping into management and/or climbing
the ladder into the upper ranks would help you, yeah, well, ... not so
much. When push comes to shove, you can still lose and find out you
never actually had any leverage.

所以，如果你曾经想过进入管理和/或攀登
进入上层的阶梯会帮助你，是的，嗯，......不是这样
很多。到了最关键的时候，你仍然可以失败并发现你
实际上从来没有任何影响力。

Just remember: reasonable exchanges only happen with reasonable people. 

请记住：合理的交流只发生在合理的人身上。
