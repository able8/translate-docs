# You can't buy DevOps

# 你买不到 DevOps

## But plenty of people are happy to sell it to you. Here's why it's not for sale.

## 但是很多人很乐意把它卖给你。这就是它不出售的原因。

Making a move to [DevOps](https://opensource.com/resources/devops) can be a daunting undertaking, with many organizations not knowing the right place to start. I recently had some fun taking a few "DevOps assessments" to see what solutions they offered. I varied my answers—from an organization that fully embraces DevOps to one at the beginning of the journey. Some of the assessments provided real value, linking me back to articles on culture and methodologies, while others merely offered me a tool promising to bring all my DevOps dreams into reality.

转向 [DevOps](https://opensource.com/resources/devops) 可能是一项艰巨的任务，许多组织不知道从哪里开始。我最近参加了一些“DevOps 评估”，看看他们提供了哪些解决方案，这让我很开心。我的答案多种多样——从一个完全接受 DevOps 的组织到一个在旅程开始时的组织。一些评估提供了真正的价值，将我与有关文化和方法论的文章联系起来，而其他评估只是为我提供了一个工具，有望将我所有的 DevOps 梦想变为现实。

Tools are absolutely essential to the DevOps journey; for instance, tools can continuously deliver, automate, or monitor your environment. However, **DevOps is not a product**, and tools alone will not enable the processes necessary to realize the full value of DevOps. People are what matter most; you can't do DevOps without building the people, mindset, and culture first.

工具对于 DevOps 之旅绝对必不可少；例如，工具可以持续交付、自动化或监控您的环境。但是，**DevOps 不是产品**，仅靠工具无法实现实现 DevOps 全部价值所需的流程。人是最重要的；如果不首先建立人员、思维方式和文化，就无法进行 DevOps。

## Don't 'win' at DevOps; become a champion

## 不要在 DevOps 中“获胜”；成为冠军

As a DevOps advocate at PagerDuty, I am proud to be a part of an organization with a strong commitment to DevOps methodologies, well beyond just "checking the boxes" of tool adoption.

作为 PagerDuty 的 DevOps 倡导者，我很自豪能成为一个对 DevOps 方法有坚定承诺的组织的一员，而不仅仅是“检查工具采用的复选框”。

I recently had a conversation with PagerDuty CEO Jennifer Tejada about being a winner versus a champion. She talked about how winning is fantastic—you get a trophy, a title, or maybe even a few million dollars (if it's the lottery). However, in the big picture, winning is all about short-term goals, while being a champion means focusing on long-term successes or outcomes. This got me thinking about how to apply this principle to organizations embracing DevOps.

我最近与 PagerDuty 首席执行官 Jennifer Tejada 进行了一次关于成为赢家与冠军的对话。她谈到获胜是多么美妙——你会得到一座奖杯、一个头衔，甚至可能是几百万美元（如果是彩票的话）。然而，从大局来看，获胜只是短期目标，而成为冠军意味着关注长期的成功或结果。这让我开始思考如何将这一原则应用于采用 DevOps 的组织。

One of my favorite examples of DevOps tooling is XebiaLabs' [Periodic Table of DevOps Tools](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/):

## [periodic-table-of-devops-tools.png](http://opensource.com/file/436571)

我最喜欢的 DevOps 工具示例之一是 XebiaLabs 的 [DevOps 工具周期表](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/)：

## [periodic-table-of-devops-tools.png](http://opensource.com/file/436571)

[![Periodic Table of DevOps](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/uploads/periodic-table-of-devops-tools.png)\

(Click table for interactive version.)](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/)



The table shows that numerous tools fit into DevOps. However, too many times, I have heard about organizations "transforming to DevOps" by purchasing tools. While tooling is an essential part of the DevOps journey, a tool alone does not create a DevOps environment. You have to consider all the factors that make a DevOps team function well: collaboration, breaking down silos, defined processes, ownership, and automation, along with continuous improvement/continuous delivery.

该表显示了许多适合 DevOps 的工具。然而，太多次，我听说组织通过购买工具“转型为 DevOps”。虽然工具是 DevOps 旅程的重要组成部分，但仅靠工具并不能创建 DevOps 环境。您必须考虑使 DevOps 团队运作良好的所有因素：协作、打破孤岛、定义流程、所有权和自动化，以及持续改进/持续交付。

Deciding to purchase tooling is a great step in the right direction; what is more important is to define the "why" or the end goal behind decisions first. Which brings us back to the mentality of a champion; look at Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps, for example. Phelps is the most decorated Olympian of all time and holds 39 world records. To achieve these accomplishments, Phelps didn't stop at one, two, or even 20 wins; he aimed to be a champion. This was all done through commitment, practice, and focusing on the desired end state.

决定购买工具是朝着正确方向迈出的重要一步；更重要的是首先定义决策背后的“原因”或最终目标。这让我们回到了冠军的心态；以奥运金牌得主迈克尔菲尔普斯为例。菲尔普斯是有史以来装饰最华丽的奥运选手，拥有 39 项世界纪录。为了取得这些成就，菲尔普斯并没有止步于一场、两场甚至是 20 场胜利；他的目标是成为冠军。这一切都是通过承诺、实践和专注于理想的最终状态来完成的。

## DevOps defined

## DevOps 定义

There are hundreds of definitions for DevOps, but almost everyone can agree on the core tenet outlined in the [State of DevOps Report](https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report):

> "DevOps is a set of principles aimed at building culture and processes to help teams work more efficiently and deliver better software faster."

DevOps 有数百个定义，但几乎每个人都同意 [DevOps 现状报告](https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report) 中概述的核心原则：

> “DevOps 是一套旨在建立文化和流程的原则，以帮助团队更有效地工作并更快地交付更好的软件。”

You can't change culture and processes with a credit card. Tooling can enable an organization to collaborate better or automate or continuously deliver; however, without the right mindset and adoption, a tool's full capability may not be achievable. 

你不能用信用卡改变文化和流程。工具可以使组织更好地协作或自动化或持续交付；然而，如果没有正确的心态和采用，工具的全部功能可能无法实现。

For example, one of my former colleagues heard how amazing Slack is for teams transforming to DevOps by opening up channels for collaboration. He convinced his manager that Slack would solve all of their communication woes. However, six months into the Slack adoption, most teams were still using Skype, including the manager. Slack ended up being more of a place to talk about brewing beer than a tool to bring the product to market faster. The issue was not Slack; it was the lack of buy-in from the team and organization and knowledge around the product's full functionality.

例如，我的一位前同事听说 Slack 对通过开放协作渠道向 DevOps 转型的团队来说是多么了不起。他说服他的经理，Slack 会解决他们所有的沟通问题。然而，在采用 Slack 的六个月后，大多数团队仍在使用 Skype，包括经理。 Slack 最终更像是一个谈论酿造啤酒的地方，而不是一个将产品更快地推向市场的工具。问题不在于 Slack。原因在于团队和组织缺乏对产品完整功能的认可。

Purchasing a tool can definitely be a win for a team, but purchasing a tool is not purchasing DevOps. Making tooling and best practices work for the team and achieving short- and long-term goals are where our conversation around being a champion comes up. This brings us back to the why, the overall and far-reaching goal for the team or organization. Once you identify the goal, how do you get buy-in from key stakeholders? After you achieve buy-in, how do you implement the solution?

购买工具绝对是团队的胜利，但购买工具并不是购买 DevOps。让工具和最佳实践为团队工作并实现短期和长期目标是我们围绕成为冠军的话题。这让我们回到团队或组织的总体目标和深远目标。一旦确定了目标，您如何获得主要利益相关者的支持？获得认可后，您如何实施解决方案？

## Organizational change

## 组织变革

Change is hard for many organizations and individuals; moreover, meaningful change does not happen overnight. It is important to understand how people and organizations process change. In the [Kotter 8-Step Process for Leading Change](https://www.kotterinc.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/), it's about articulating the need for a change, creating urgency around the why, then starting small and finding and developing internal champions, _before_ trying to prove wins or, in this case, purchasing a tool.

对于许多组织和个人来说，变革是困难的；此外，有意义的变化不会在一夜之间发生。了解人和组织如何处理变化非常重要。在 [Kotter 领导变革的 8 步流程](https://www.kotterinc.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/) 中，它是关于阐明变革的需求，围绕变革创造紧迫性为什么，然后从小处开始，寻找和培养内部冠军，_before_ 试图证明胜利，或者在这种情况下，购买工具。

If people in an organization are not aware of a problem or that there's a better way of operating, it will be hard to get the buy-in necessary and motivate team members to adopt new ideas and take action. People may be perfectly content with the current state; perhaps the processes in place are adequate or, at a minimum, the current state is a known factor. However, for the overall team to function well and achieve its shared goal in a faster, more agile way, new mechanisms must be put into place first.

如果组织中的人没有意识到问题或有更好的运营方式，就很难获得必要的支持并激励团队成员采用新想法并采取行动。人们可能对目前的状态非常满意；也许现有的流程是足够的，或者至少目前的状态是一个已知因素。然而，为了让整个团队良好运作并以更快、更敏捷的方式实现其共同目标，必须首先建立新机制。

## How to be a DevOps champion

## 如何成为 DevOps 冠军

Being a champion in the DevOps world means going beyond the win and delving deeper into the team/organizational structure and culture, thereby identifying outlying issues beyond tools, and then working with others to embrace the right change that leads to defined results. Go back to the beginning and define the end goal. Here are a few sample questions you can ask to get started:

- What are your core values?
- Why are you trying to become a more agile company or team?
- What obstacles is your team or organization facing?
- What will the tool or process accomplish?
- How are people communicating and collaborating?
- Are there silos and why?
- How are you championing the customer?
- Are employees empowered?

成为 DevOps 世界的冠军意味着超越胜利并深入研究团队/组织结构和文化，从而识别工具之外的外围问题，然后与他人合作接受正确的变革，从而产生明确的结果。回到起点并定义最终目标。以下是您可以在开始时提出的一些示例问题：

- 你的核心价值观是什么？
- 你为什么要努力成为一个更敏捷的公司或团队？
- 您的团队或组织面临哪些障碍？
- 工具或过程将完成什么？
- 人们如何沟通和协作？
- 是否有筒仓，为什么？
- 你如何支持客户？
- 员工是否被授权？

After defining the end state, find other like-minded individuals to be part of your champion team, and don't lose sight of what you are trying to accomplish. When making any change, make sure to start small, e.g., with one team or a test environment. By starting small and building on the wins, internal champions will start creating themselves.

确定最终状态后，寻找其他志同道合的人加入您的冠军团队，不要忘记您正在努力实现的目标。进行任何更改时，请确保从小处着手，例如，从一个团队或一个测试环境开始。通过从小处开始并以胜利为基础，内部冠军将开始创造自己。

Remember, companies are happy and eager to try to sell you DevOps, but at the end of the day, DevOps is not a product. It is a fully embraced methodology and mindset of automation, collaboration, people, and processes.

请记住，公司很高兴并渴望向您推销 DevOps，但归根结底，DevOps 不是产品。它是一种完全接受的自动化、协作、人员和流程的方法论和思维方式。
