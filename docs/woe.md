## HR is not your friend, and other things I think you should know

Sunday, January 17, 2021

HR is not your friend. HR is there to support the company. If you are
not the company, they are not going to be there to support you.

HR boils down to paid witnesses in some cases. It changes it from a
"you said, the boss said" thing to two-on-one (or worse). They just pay
attention and maybe give a sworn statement down the road if things turn
truly nasty.

Who else operates like that? Mall cops and security guards. They don't
have guns. They have phones and notepads. So, it's really mall cops,
security guards... and HR.

The only time I ever had a conversation with HR even marginally improve
something is when I was on the "side" of the company and was reporting
something involving personnel to them so they could keep the company
out of trouble.

That is, person A did something evil to person B, and I was person A's
nominal supervisor. I was required (CA law!) to report it to HR, and I
did, and that was that. HR yelled at person A while I watched. That's
about how it went.

If person B had reported it to HR, nothing probably would have happened.

This is clear because person B DID in fact report something to them a
different time for someone else, and nothing happened to the evil
person. Why? Because this time the evil person was someone on the
company's side (management), and therefore is going to be somewhat
protected by default.

"Oh, you're just imagining it". "Oh, it didn't happen". That kind of
stuff.

Expert gaslighters, they are. What really makes me wonder is how the
people keep doing these jobs. Many of them are in the very classes that
get abused by other people regularly. How can you honestly keep doing
that job when you are just enabling the abusers?

Side note: person B's report to HR about this evil person came up in
person B's "calibration session", which is part of performance reviews
at that company. Some quick-witted manager type promptly spoke up and
stopped that particular conversation thread. I was there and heard it
myself.

So let's talk about performance reviews now.

Performance reviews are a joke because almost nobody knows how to
measure anyone else's effectiveness. They are just a continuation of
the same popularity contests you thought you left behind from middle
school, high school, and maybe even your college/university days if you
were able to attend such places. The reasoning is simple enough: the
people doing the assessments are still back in that mindset, so it's
unsurprising that they bring it forward into reviews.

Accordingly, hiring reviews are just about as random as performance
reviews. Look at it another way - a performance review is based on
having worked with someone for an extended period of time, and it's
still frequently used to prop up the cronies and knock down anyone who
doesn't spout the party line. Given that an interview is based on a
handful of phone calls and maybe a day of focused interviews, is
it so surprising that they are also broken?

Really, most hiring reviews come down to: did this person resemble the
other people we already have here. Never mind if the reason the place
is broken is because they keep hiring the same sort of person and really
need to shift. It's like, how well do they blend in with our \*idea\* of
what it takes to do the job?

Let me say this another way: I have empirically determined that very few
company situations actually give a shit about whether someone is bad at
their job. It doesn't matter how much data you produce or stories you
can come up with. If it doesn't fit the narrative someone else wants to
push, nothing will happen to them. Also, if \*you\* push hard enough to
"fix" the situation, guess what? YOU become the problem.

One exception to this that I've found is when someone already has
plans for getting rid of someone and just needs the "ammo". At that
point, they will quickly become your "friend" in order to get all of
the dirt on that person, and then once the deed is done, it'll be like
you never existed to them.

Alternatively, if you can prove the person is harming the company
somehow, then yeah, they will probably gang up on them and that'll be
that. But, again, it has to be something visible that lines up with
whatever their party line may be. "Sits there moistening a chair and
never does anything useful" is not sufficient. It has to be something
really nasty like "exposes the company to lawsuits". THEN they start
paying attention.

Imagine every bad "evil villain" trope you've ever witnessed by watching
crappy TV dramas or bad movies. They're not that much of a stretch.
Some of those screenwriters probably worked in companies like this
before putting pen to paper.

In terms of weirdly broken people, there are many different types. If
you are the sort who honestly expects everyone to be reasonable, honest
and generally agreeable, prepare to be shocked. The longer it takes you
to realize this, the longer the most evil ones will take advantage of
you.

One type you should be aware of is the person who will change their
story from day to day in order to "win" the "argument" that's currently
underway. If you have a decent memory for conversations, you might
think you are losing your mind, because surely this person was FOR this
last week, but now they are AGAINST it?

It's not because they decided to change their mind - people are
certainly allowed (and expected) to shift based on new information.
It's just so they win this time. Come back to them a few days later,
and they might be in yet another spot.

Imagine working with a person like this when you're trying to get
something done that involves their team acting like a gatekeeper. You
get the approval from them on doing something one way, then plow a bunch
of time into developing it, and then when it's time to deliver things,
that same person gets in the way and stops the whole affair.

This really happens in some isolated cases, and it's maddening as hell.
In those situations, you really come to appreciate your chat logs. Of
course, if they have been sticking to in-person chats (in normal times,
not now, obviously) or phone/video calls, good luck! Those usually
aren't logged. Wiretapping laws are funny that way.

...

I have another thought here and can't come up with a decent segue so
we'll just do a needle-scratch and jump right into it. This one is that
sometimes the "full bird" higher-ups at a company are in fact powerless.
It doesn't matter if their title is VP or SVP or CTO or whatever. When
the rubber meets the road, they may be a figurehead, unable to make
things actually stick.

I learned about a situation like this from someone who's been deeply
involved with any number of companies and wound up at one of those
high-level positions at one later in their career. They were supposed
to be the final word on the technical details of what went out the door.
This person is the real deal, incidentally. They know the ins and outs
of the whole situation, and was exactly who you'd want in that position.

In that role, the company gave them the power to say "this way and not
that way", but also put this person in the spot of being responsible
for whatever happened as a result. It was on them to make good
decisions that made sense in terms of the existing product line, the
ones under development, and the stuff they wanted to do.

Then, one day, one of those decisions came to a head and needed the
final call from this person. They made the call to go one particular
way since it made better engineering sense with the work they were
already doing. What the other people wanted would add far more variance
to their eng work and would generally be incompatible with the existing
stuff. There was no benefit to it, other than some other person
"getting their way".

It came down to this: either this person was in fact their head honcho
of whatever it was, and they were making that decision, or they were
not. The company said... you are not. It was as simple as that.

They didn't stick around after that. Would you?

So, if you've ever thought that jumping into management and/or climbing
the ladder into the upper ranks would help you, yeah, well, ... not so
much. When push comes to shove, you can still lose and find out you
never actually had any leverage.

Just remember: reasonable exchanges only happen with reasonable people.
