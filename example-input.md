##### [What is Kubernetes?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)     

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that  facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
It has a  large, rapidly growing ecosystem. 
Kubernetes services, support, and  tools are widely available.

##### [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/)     

A Kubernetes cluster consists of the components that represent the control plane and a set of machines called nodes.

##### [The Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/)     

The Kubernetes API lets you query and manipulate  the state of objects in Kubernetes.
The core of Kubernetes' control  plane is the API server and the HTTP API that it exposes.
Users, the  different parts of your cluster, and external components all communicate with one another through the API server.

##### [Working with Kubernetes Objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/)     

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system.
Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the  state of your cluster.
Learn about the Kubernetes object model and how  to work with these objects.
